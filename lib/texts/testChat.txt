23/07/2014, 12:13 - abigailcoe: The date made me identify a problem I have, in terms of my own insecurities, and I need to talk it out at some point

04/08/2014, 16:34 - Big Ran: I'm going to try and use new paste on the heatsink first and clean the fans as that's the only thing that annoys me really.  You need twrm or Cwm bootloader to install the thing.  But first you have to root it on a pc to get it installed.  How was your date? X

04/08/2014, 17:11 - Big Ran: Amaaazing x
04/08/2014, 17:11 - abigailcoe: Yay! Thanks x
04/08/2014, 17:12 - Big Ran: I nearly did the other day,  I could get the top 13 with apple care for just over a grand.  But it's a grand! X
04/08/2014, 17:13 - abigailcoe: You get someone with the discount to buy it so it's only 900 x
04/08/2014, 17:13 - abigailcoe: And you got 500 for free! X
04/08/2014, 17:13 - abigailcoe: And you can sell your old one! Xx

04/08/2014, 17:17 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
04/08/2014, 17:17 - Big Ran: I don't know if I would with this though,   you know how happy broken things make me and hope bad I am at looking after things x
04/08/2014, 17:17 - Big Ran: Maybe I'll get one just before I stop my course x
04/08/2014, 17:17 - abigailcoe: Yeah true, but you do complain about yours a fair amount x
04/08/2014, 17:17 - abigailcoe: That's not happy x
04/08/2014, 17:17 - Big Ran: Omg,  well jels x
04/08/2014, 17:18 - abigailcoe: It's the fixing that makes you happy x

04/08/2014, 17:21 - Big Ran: The mini version of my 09 (£20), it's fucked but the motherboard world and I have that one I bought ages ago so hopefully combined they will work.  And I just bid 200 for a 2012 with broken glass on the screen but not lcd x
04/08/2014, 17:22 - abigailcoe: That sounds pretty good x
04/08/2014, 17:23 - Big Ran: The guy with the totally fucked one (which I originally bid 180)ended up just offering it to me for the price of the postage because he broke the trackpad after the auction and couldnt re-install OS x
04/08/2014, 17:24 - abigailcoe: Haha! So good x
04/08/2014, 17:24 - Big Ran: Do you have a computer there you can root your phone with? X
04/08/2014, 17:26 - abigailcoe: I don't know, I think there's a pc here, yeah. X
04/08/2014, 17:26 - abigailcoe: Don't have the first idea how to go about it x
04/08/2014, 17:27 - Big Ran: I'll see if I can find a good guide x
04/08/2014, 17:28 - abigailcoe: Thanks xx
05/08/2014, 09:52 - Big Ran: Two questions for you.  What temperature does your cpu run at when idle and when playing HD YouTube things? And do the yurt need any staff? Olivia's friend is moving from London and looking for work xx
05/08/2014, 09:55 - abigailcoe: I just opened it up and pissed around on the internet for ten minutes, it had been torrenting for me overnight, and it's 35 on my lap x
05/08/2014, 09:55 - Big Ran: Haha damn that's low x
05/08/2014, 09:56 - abigailcoe: We might do, tell her to go in, with a cv, NOT between the hours of 12 and 2, and ask for Shona, introduce herself and give her the CV, and cross her fingers xx
05/08/2014, 09:56 - abigailcoe: It's good isn't it! X
05/08/2014, 09:56 - abigailcoe: I'll just play some videos x
05/08/2014, 09:57 - Big Ran: I will tell him to speak to shona,  he's called tom cruise but he can't make cocktails! X
05/08/2014, 09:58 - Big Ran: I just got my new macbook (the mini version of mine) and it works great, really quiet but very hot x
05/08/2014, 09:59 - Big Ran: Bit apparently apple did this on purpose.  Runs up to 100C before fans go higher x
05/08/2014, 10:00 - Big Ran: Although I haven't managed to do this yet x
05/08/2014, 10:03 - abigailcoe: Haha, is he good at waiting/bar work in general? Because if he's not, don't tell him to go in at all. He might get a shift or two and then not get any more and that gets super awkward x
05/08/2014, 10:04 - abigailcoe: Runs up to 100! X
05/08/2014, 10:04 - abigailcoe: Three 1080p on screen all at once, 59 degrees xx
05/08/2014, 10:05 - abigailcoe: Is your new one good? I can't wait to meet it x
05/08/2014, 10:05 - abigailcoe: What was wrong with it? X
05/08/2014, 10:06 - Big Ran: It had a crack in the glass and trackpad and bullying battery.  All fixed now x
05/08/2014, 10:07 - abigailcoe: Amazing. Bullying?
05/08/2014, 10:07 - Big Ran: I have no idea if he has experience so I'll just not say anything and if he goes in he goes in x
05/08/2014, 10:08 - abigailcoe: Ok cool x
05/08/2014, 10:08 - Big Ran: Bulging x
05/08/2014, 10:08 - abigailcoe: Oh, did you just swap it out? X
05/08/2014, 10:08 - Big Ran: Sorry I should let you have your holiday.  Are you having a lovely time? X
05/08/2014, 10:08 - abigailcoe: And how old was this one? X
05/08/2014, 10:09 - abigailcoe: I love chatting to you, holiday or no. I'd enjoy my holiday less if we didn't chat. Xx
05/08/2014, 10:09 - Big Ran: This is the 09, same spec as my big one x
05/08/2014, 10:09 - abigailcoe: And I am having a lovely time! X
05/08/2014, 10:09 - Big Ran: Ah good that's what I'd hope tips day  :) x
05/08/2014, 10:10 - Big Ran: You'd say x
05/08/2014, 10:10 - abigailcoe: Haha, definitely x
05/08/2014, 10:10 - Big Ran: I like the small macbooks but I want higher resolution x
05/08/2014, 10:11 - abigailcoe: Got pretty drunk last night, but woke up early, made a pot of tea and some avocado on toast and went back to bed. Mazers. X
05/08/2014, 10:11 - abigailcoe: Are the bigger ones higher res? X
05/08/2014, 10:11 - Big Ran: Aaawww that sounds lush x
05/08/2014, 10:12 - abigailcoe: You know, having internet on holiday feels so luxurious, but it shouldn't. I like it. Haha, I'm in a funny mood X
05/08/2014, 10:12 - Big Ran: Yeah they do 1440 x900 x
05/08/2014, 10:13 - abigailcoe: Oohhhh x
05/08/2014, 10:13 - Big Ran: Yeah it is,  I imagine holidays like factory cottage where you have to leave your phone on a ledge x
05/08/2014, 10:14 - Big Ran: Yeah I don't mind the small screen just want it to have same resolution x
05/08/2014, 10:14 - abigailcoe: Yeah, I get that. I'm surprised you don't mind the smaller screen x
05/08/2014, 10:15 - abigailcoe: Yeah, there's phone reception here too! H! X
05/08/2014, 10:15 - Big Ran: I'll take it as the whole thing is smaller and I like that x
05/08/2014, 10:15 - Big Ran: H! Oh my x
05/08/2014, 10:16 - abigailcoe: I know right! And we're proper in the country! X
05/08/2014, 10:16 - abigailcoe: Is it your day off? X
05/08/2014, 10:17 - Big Ran: Although I think I just like it because I've used the big one for so long so it seems like it's a mini version x
05/08/2014, 10:17 - Big Ran: Yeah,  I was gonna sleep in but then the post man arrived with the laptop so obviously I had to get my bed coveted in tiny screws x
05/08/2014, 10:17 - abigailcoe: Haha, sweet. It is a great size generally. I always go back to Rick's thing about being easy to cart about x
05/08/2014, 10:18 - abigailcoe: Obviously x
05/08/2014, 10:18 - abigailcoe: So you're having an amazing morning x
05/08/2014, 10:19 - Big Ran: Yes it is. I'm drinking my first aeropress cold brew too x
05/08/2014, 10:19 - abigailcoe: Oh how did it go! X
05/08/2014, 10:20 - abigailcoe: I took Kieran to fcp and got him a cold brew and he's obsessed now x
05/08/2014, 10:20 - Big Ran: It went alright but I used hazelnut flavoured coffee which is a bit weird x
05/08/2014, 10:21 - abigailcoe: You have to teach me when you figure it out x
05/08/2014, 10:21 - Big Ran: And I need a new plunger seal if I'm gonna do it regular as it leaked a little x
05/08/2014, 10:21 - abigailcoe: Faaack x
05/08/2014, 10:22 - abigailcoe: Did you do the inverted brew? I guess you'd have to X
05/08/2014, 10:23 - Big Ran: yeah,  apparently you can do it normal and it only drips a little.  I didn't clean it though so it might have had coffee grounds in between the thing and the thing x
05/08/2014, 10:24 - abigailcoe: Haha, ok x
05/08/2014, 10:24 - abigailcoe: The thing and the thing x
10/08/2014, 16:04 - Big Ran: I think I'm going to have to not tea today,  my teeth is mega hurting and im totally not very normal.  Much love.  Are you working tomorrow? I should finish at about 3 xx
10/08/2014, 16:38 - abigailcoe: Oh poor bear, that's cool. I'm off all day tomorrow woo woo, call me when you're done. Hope you get through the tooth pain ok xx
11/08/2014, 13:18 - Big Ran: It looks like I'm gonna finish fairly early but have no bike.  Fancy meeting me somewhere like near town or something? Xx
11/08/2014, 13:22 - abigailcoe: Sure thing, tell me where xx
11/08/2014, 14:13 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
11/08/2014, 14:16 - Big Ran: Where is that?
11/08/2014, 14:16 - Big Ran: I just finishing now x
14/08/2014, 19:27 - abigailcoe: Did the root canal happen? X
14/08/2014, 19:28 - Big Ran: No she took it out,  apparently can't do root canal if you don't have sides left x
14/08/2014, 19:28 - abigailcoe: But no pain? X
14/08/2014, 19:29 - Big Ran: No,  just a lonely tooth x
14/08/2014, 19:40 - abigailcoe: Does it still hurt?! X
14/08/2014, 20:03 - Big Ran: My jaw aches I think from the needless😤  but generally no pain.  Woo x
14/08/2014, 20:05 - abigailcoe: Woo! I'd think it was more likely the wrenching of your tooth from the gum that makes the ache, but either way, no pain generally is winning xx
14/08/2014, 21:40 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
14/08/2014, 21:40 - abigailcoe: Haha amaze x
14/08/2014, 21:59 - Big Ran: Shh they're sleeping x

15/08/2014, 16:32 - Big Ran: Htc one m8! X
15/08/2014, 16:32 - abigailcoe: For reals? Have you thought about it?
15/08/2014, 16:34 - Big Ran: Yeah,  basically performance wise I think it's a lot better and more reliable but it's not waterproof and i read one rant about the camera not being that good in normal daylight as its designed for low light xx
15/08/2014, 16:35 - abigailcoe: Haha, is the S5? Waterproof? Htc looks way better build quality, but S5 gots big battery  xx
15/08/2014, 16:37 - Big Ran: Yeah I just reckon they made it cheaply x
15/08/2014, 16:38 - abigailcoe: M-kay x
16/08/2014, 11:18 - abigailcoe: Hello! Can I come to yours and make power balls later? My magimix is in storage xx
16/08/2014, 11:42 - Big Ran: Morning lovely,  I don't have my magimix yet but you can try in a combo of my lame apparatus.  I'm gonna finish work at about half one,  going camping but not till about half four xx
16/08/2014, 11:52 - abigailcoe: Cool! I think you can soak the dates quickly in hot water which will make it easier. See you about half two? Xx
16/08/2014, 12:28 - Big Ran: Yeah that's perfect xx
19/08/2014, 11:52 - abigailcoe: That piece of do not redirect post came through, woop. And I've cancelled my T-Mobile contract, htc one emm eight (as the retentions lady pronounced it) here I come! Xx
19/08/2014, 11:53 - Big Ran: Haha good news on both accounts xx
19/08/2014, 11:54 - Big Ran: I am in London,  got my magimix and ordered the new part.  Woo x
19/08/2014, 12:03 - abigailcoe: Woo how was camping? X
19/08/2014, 12:10 - Big Ran: Yeah it was good,  we pretty much got there,  drank all the booze,  slept,  walked up the hill,  then came home x
19/08/2014, 12:10 - Big Ran: How are you? X

26/08/2014, 10:04 - Big Ran: H2obuffalo x
26/08/2014, 10:08 - Big Ran: My phone has gone a bit mental.  Think it may have had a bit too much beer x
26/08/2014, 10:09 - abigailcoe: Did you have fun? X
26/08/2014, 10:09 - abigailcoe: You can have my phone x
26/08/2014, 10:10 - Big Ran: Yes I had loads of fun.  How have you been lovely? X
26/08/2014, 10:10 - Big Ran: I'm just in the train to si's x
26/08/2014, 10:12 - abigailcoe: I've been fine, obsessed with jai Paul and the unofficial album at present
26/08/2014, 10:12 - abigailcoe: How long you going there for? Did you come home inbetween? Xx
26/08/2014, 10:13 - Big Ran: Oooo who is that? X

26/08/2014, 10:22 - Big Ran: How was your another date? X
26/08/2014, 10:22 - Big Ran: I'm gone till Sunday /Monday x
26/08/2014, 10:27 - abigailcoe: Some Indian dude signed to xl, he's been working on his album for four years, and someone put an album by him on bandcamp last year, but it was robbed so it got taken down, and he still hasn't released anything x
26/08/2014, 10:28 - abigailcoe: I think you'll like parts of it and not others x
26/08/2014, 10:28 - abigailcoe: I'll play you some when you come home xx
26/08/2014, 10:28 - Big Ran: Oooo I'm excited about listening to it x
26/08/2014, 10:28 - abigailcoe: Which is so far away! I've been missing you x
26/08/2014, 10:29 - abigailcoe: Good! I love it all, it's really good, some good clicky noises and shit x
26/08/2014, 10:30 - Big Ran: You too lovely! We can have lots of tea and eating when I get back.  And listening to tuuuuunes x
26/08/2014, 10:30 - abigailcoe: Sweeeeeett x
26/08/2014, 10:30 - abigailcoe: And playing with my maaaaate x
26/08/2014, 10:31 - abigailcoe: Oh, date was lovely thank you, we were both ill but it was lush, he is lush xx

31/08/2014, 19:45 - abigailcoe: Are you back? I'm not having a nice time right now xx
31/08/2014, 20:57 - Big Ran: Oh lovely I'm sorry.  I'm back but in the midst of hectic helping Ely move house right now.  Are you working tomorrow? Should be around between helping for tea and hugs xx
31/08/2014, 20:58 - Big Ran: What's going on or is it just generally badness? Xx
31/08/2014, 21:00 - abigailcoe: Day off tomorrow! Boy being weird :( xx
31/08/2014, 21:01 - abigailcoe: Great use and correct spelling of the word midst x
31/08/2014, 21:01 - Big Ran: Haha I thought you'd like that x
31/08/2014, 21:02 - Big Ran: Only for you x
31/08/2014, 21:02 - abigailcoe: Thank you xx
31/08/2014, 21:04 - abigailcoe: This is why I never believe it when anyone tells me I'm amazing, because when I meet a nice boy, they never seem to stick around. But who knows, maybe I'm just being mental. Fingers crossed x
31/08/2014, 21:06 - Big Ran: Yeah I know that option isn't great but I am still doing that even though my situation is pretty secure xx
31/08/2014, 21:06 - abigailcoe: Finger crossing? Shut it, you're fine xx
31/08/2014, 21:42 - abigailcoe: I think it's ok and I am just insane. That's probably what puts boys off me. Xx
03/09/2014, 11:54 - Big Ran: The house next to keepers cottage is up for sale https://www.emoov.co.uk/property/ae8062c9-9353-4b68-a7a0-844449d4eb31 x
04/09/2014, 21:28 - abigailcoe: Oh, that'd do. Four bedrooms but twenty rooms in total? That's cray cray. X
07/09/2014, 23:37 - abigailcoe: Your birthday party is the same day as Guinness's wedding. Major sad face xx
08/09/2014, 12:14 - abigailcoe: Are you working today? Need a lift to clevedon xx
08/09/2014, 12:15 - Big Ran: Sorry I'm working.  Would be finished by 4 though if that's any good x
08/09/2014, 12:16 - abigailcoe: I'll call them and see if I can change the time x
08/09/2014, 12:43 - abigailcoe: Would I possibly be able to get a lift to my chiropractor for 7 this evening? I'll buy you dinner and petrol, ovbs, and no worries if not xx
08/09/2014, 12:45 - Big Ran: Yeah that should be fine if I can get a car x
08/09/2014, 12:45 - abigailcoe: You're my hero xx
08/09/2014, 13:11 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
08/09/2014, 13:11 - Big Ran: I think he might be called ray
08/09/2014, 13:13 - abigailcoe: Hahaha, I thought it was just the middle one, and thought "that could totally just be a coincidence" but oh no. X
08/09/2014, 13:14 - Big Ran: The other three cars have sue sue sue.  Xx
08/09/2014, 13:28 - abigailcoe: Where is that? Why do they need six cars? And two pick ups? Xx
08/09/2014, 13:38 - Big Ran: 2 mercs,  both the same.  3 pickups xx
08/09/2014, 13:39 - Big Ran: Mentalists,  in Stockwood x
09/09/2014, 14:34 - abigailcoe: What's the haps? X
10/09/2014, 14:08 - abigailcoe: Stuck in Sainsbury's car park now, booooo x
10/09/2014, 15:49 - Big Ran: Oh no not again. Xx
10/09/2014, 17:57 - abigailcoe: Utopia is Brilliant. X
10/09/2014, 17:58 - Big Ran: It's good isn't it? X
10/09/2014, 17:59 - abigailcoe: Yeah! Not even finished the first episode yet, but I'm loving it. How was your day? X
10/09/2014, 17:59 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
10/09/2014, 17:59 - abigailcoe: Yay! I hope you put them straight in the fridge? X
10/09/2014, 18:00 - Big Ran: I certainly did.  My day was sweaty x
10/09/2014, 18:01 - Big Ran: How was yours.  Did they make it work again? X
10/09/2014, 18:03 - abigailcoe: It's got a really annoying habit of working just before the man arrives, or just after I order the recovery. This time I spent about two hours trying to fix it myself, even went to the range to buy spanners, and had a random mechanic in the car park try and help me, but to no avail. Then I called up breakdown and it worked.
10/09/2014, 18:04 - abigailcoe: I'm gonna try and take the crank sensor off and clean it tomorrow or see if it needs relaxing, hopefully that'll help. X
10/09/2014, 18:05 - abigailcoe: Fine day though, in Pickwick now. Still tired but not as bad as yesterday, that was the pits xx
10/09/2014, 18:05 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
10/09/2014, 18:05 - abigailcoe: Haha, amazing x
10/09/2014, 18:05 - abigailcoe: But not true xx
10/09/2014, 18:05 - Big Ran: Oh that's good,  glad it's getting better not worse ,  best place to be xx
10/09/2014, 18:06 - Big Ran: No not true x
10/09/2014, 18:06 - Big Ran: Have you listened to latest 99pi? X
10/09/2014, 18:06 - abigailcoe: I'm sure I'll just get better now x
10/09/2014, 18:06 - abigailcoe: Nope, what's it about?x
10/09/2014, 18:07 - Big Ran: Things like the farm in the m62 x
10/09/2014, 18:07 - Big Ran: Holdouts they call them x
10/09/2014, 18:07 - abigailcoe: Oh yeah! I saw a picture of the house by the strip mall, it looks brilliant x
10/09/2014, 18:14 - abigailcoe: Oh no, Wilson's eyes! I like Wilson. X
10/09/2014, 19:04 - abigailcoe: Haha, I just remembered I took my toothpaste with me and there isn't any other in the house. I'm such a mean sneaky sneak x
10/09/2014, 19:22 - abigailcoe: Are the trackpads on our Macs covered in plastic? X
10/09/2014, 19:23 - Big Ran: Haha good work on the toothpastes x
10/09/2014, 19:24 - Big Ran: No they are glass with silver shit underneath x
10/09/2014, 19:24 - abigailcoe: Sweet, glass isn't metal. I'm getting metal paranoid, obvs x
10/09/2014, 19:26 - Big Ran: Well that is fair enough as it is pretty hard to use the computer without touching the metal all the time x
12/09/2014, 14:24 - abigailcoe: It's arrived! It's arrived! Your present has arrived! X
12/09/2014, 14:27 - Big Ran: Woooo! Exciting xx

12/09/2014, 14:45 - Big Ran: Oh did I send it to you before? I think I'm going to get a nexus 5. Maybe x

15/09/2014, 09:51 - abigailcoe: You're funny. I look forward to it x
15/09/2014, 09:51 - abigailcoe: Maybe, just maybe, it's exactly right. They do have lovely screens x
15/09/2014, 09:52 - Big Ran: Yeah they do, only problems I've found so far have been about the camera and I don't really care about that too much. Oh and the Sony boat ware x
15/09/2014, 09:59 - abigailcoe: Hate those fucking boats x
15/09/2014, 17:44 - abigailcoe: Are you at home? Can I come and hide in your room please? Xx

15/09/2014, 23:04 - abigailcoe: The end was still my fave x
15/09/2014, 23:04 - Big Ran: Maybe but that seems to be just danny wainwright x
15/09/2014, 23:04 - abigailcoe: Really? I wouldn't be surprised if it was though x
15/09/2014, 23:05 - Big Ran: Oh no that must have been it.  I think it was their first one.  I remember seeing it at the cube x

19/09/2014, 09:35 - Big Ran: My phone came with an on the go cable which is a micro to normal usb so I can plug usb sticks in.  Which means you can make backups without a computer.  You can do the same,  just need the cable xx

19/09/2014, 10:28 - Big Ran: It's good I like it but I'm not wowed at all.  It has downfalls too, even over the s2. But im excited about getting a magnetic charging cable for it x

19/09/2014, 10:34 - abigailcoe: Haha, not obvious to me yet. Yeah, I remember it's what Terry used, right? But I guess I thought it was just for if you had an Xbox xx

27/09/2014, 22:27 - abigailcoe: I do not understand the internet in this house. Downloads from icefilms fail with alarming regularity and are often super slow, but I can torrent at a meg and a half. What the what? Hope you're having a lovely time! X
27/09/2014, 23:23 - Big Ran: I think its a recent addition to either chrome or the websites that ice films use as i had it at first all the time at Ely's house,  and now at mine too quite a lot,  not sure what's going on though our why x
30/09/2014, 18:43 - abigailcoe: I'm at the shop! Thought I was never gonna get here x

01/10/2014, 21:17 - Big Ran: Yeah I reckon you did,  i just don't know where I put it  x
02/10/2014, 19:03 - abigailcoe: I really really love impressing people by referencing obscure books I've not read but I can tell that they have. X

02/10/2014, 19:05 - abigailcoe: What did you tell iftt to do?x
02/10/2014, 19:05 - abigailcoe: Thanks xx
02/10/2014, 19:06 - abigailcoe: My iftt just didn't work. That is all.x
02/10/2014, 19:06 - Big Ran: Iftt pictures to my Dropbox,  because it did all the received ones too,  or something x
02/10/2014, 19:07 - abigailcoe: What's the point in that? That's what dropbox does anyway x
02/10/2014, 19:07 - abigailcoe: Oh, I see. I think.x
02/10/2014, 19:08 - Big Ran: Yeah I don't think I knew Dropbox did it at the time x

19/10/2014, 13:37 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
19/10/2014, 13:37 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
19/10/2014, 21:28 - Big Ran: They are genius, where is that? X
19/10/2014, 23:16 - abigailcoe: In Wells. Went to the cathedral with the parents, innit x
20/10/2014, 10:09 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
20/10/2014, 15:40 - abigailcoe: Haha, I love it x
20/10/2014, 23:01 - Big Ran: Hello lovely,  what's the plan for tomorrow? X
20/10/2014, 23:07 - abigailcoe: Hello sweet, I'm going to the chiropractor super early, then I'm gonna fuck around in the container for a bit, try and move a bed maybe, how about I aim to get to you about 11/half past and then we have fun times and get pizza and do nice things? X
20/10/2014, 23:11 - Big Ran: That sounds perfect and fantantabulus,  if you need help with moving things just come get me earlier x
20/10/2014, 23:13 - abigailcoe: You're the greatest, thank you so much xx
21/10/2014, 08:28 - Big Ran: Morning birthday girl! Happy birthday xx
22/10/2014, 08:19 - Big Ran: Take a look at "Telegram" - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger
22/10/2014, 08:20 - Big Ran: I thought i'd try out other messaging apps for when WhatsApp gets shit out evil xx
22/10/2014, 12:41 - Big Ran: Got 6 Daniel kitson tickets for 6th Dec,  woo! Tell your new job you can't work on that saturday.  Hehe xx
22/10/2014, 12:48 - abigailcoe: Oh, mother fucker, that's the day I'm supposed to come back for Karen's party. Help me make up a good excuse? Xx
22/10/2014, 12:50 - Big Ran: Haha,  i'm sure you can think of one by then,  like you have already  come back to bristol too much etc,  you probably have to work Friday and Monday. X
22/10/2014, 12:56 - abigailcoe: Haha, ok cool xx
23/10/2014, 20:19 - abigailcoe: Hello love, how are you? X
23/10/2014, 20:20 - abigailcoe: I'm having a lovely time so far, but I haven't seen anyone I know yet, and I'm really looking forward to getting a proper hug from someone.
23/10/2014, 20:21 - abigailcoe: I'm gonna tell you about what's weird about being in my house this evening (don't get me wrong, it's lovely here, but things are just a might odd tonight) x
23/10/2014, 20:22 - Big Ran: I'm excited x
23/10/2014, 20:22 - abigailcoe: So Kasper still has LOADS of his stuff in my room, when I arrived he'd not moved anything, so I waited for three hours yesterday with all my stuff still in the car while he cleared stuff out. He managed to clear one cupboard. Out of FIVE.
23/10/2014, 20:23 - Big Ran: Hahaha oh dear .  Sounds like me x
23/10/2014, 20:25 - abigailcoe: He came back today to clear some more stuff, and it's kind of like he's still living here, he did some tidying, then he took a shower, then his very pretty, very quiet girlfriend came round and sat at the dinner table. Kasper said he was going to the gym (Thai boxing) and asked me if I'd like to come and see it. I politely declined, so he left....
23/10/2014, 20:25 - Big Ran: That is pretty weird so far..
23/10/2014, 20:26 - abigailcoe: Jess, the girlfriend, is quite ill, something is wrong with her lung, and I offered her a cop of tea, something to eat, or at least a seat on the sofa. She said no. I carried on reading my book, and put some food in the oven...
23/10/2014, 20:28 - abigailcoe: My food took a long time to cook, gas ovens are annoying. Jess was on her phone for a while, but eventually I looked up and realised she'd fallen asleep, at the table...
23/10/2014, 20:29 - abigailcoe: I called her name and she woke up, I said she should lie down, that she was most welcome to my bed, she said no. I said she should at least lie down on the sofa. She said no. So I carried on as before...
23/10/2014, 20:31 - abigailcoe: My dinner was eventually ready, I plated it up and went to sit in the lounge, as my bedroom is awash with Kasper's stuff, I don't know if you've tried it, but eating dinner in a silent living room with an ill person you don't know passed out on the table is a little odd...
23/10/2014, 20:32 - Big Ran: I have tried it,  well replace I'll with completely wasted but yeah
23/10/2014, 20:33 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
23/10/2014, 20:33 - abigailcoe: So I gave up, called her name once again, got no response, and so took my food and my stuff into my room. I cleared a little nook on my bed and ate dinner surrounded by piles of stuff:
23/10/2014, 20:33 - abigailcoe: Ah, so you know. It's weird.xx
23/10/2014, 20:34 - Big Ran: Haha that sounds P pretty fucking word,  but I'm very glad your happy x
23/10/2014, 20:35 - Big Ran: So is he staying there tonight? After the gym x
23/10/2014, 20:35 - abigailcoe: I have no idea. I hope he'll stay at jess's x
23/10/2014, 20:36 - abigailcoe: Tell me what's happening with you please x
23/10/2014, 20:36 - Big Ran: Not much really,  been feeling a bit ill and in bed mostly x
23/10/2014, 20:36 - abigailcoe: Boo x
23/10/2014, 20:37 - Big Ran: Kind of had arguments with Ely and trying not to feel too sit about that x
23/10/2014, 20:37 - abigailcoe: What about?x
23/10/2014, 20:37 - Big Ran: Been doing some reading,  mostly the engineering bit and is really good x
23/10/2014, 20:38 - Big Ran: Oh it was sort of about stupid things but really about me doing to much for her and not enough for myself,  story of my love life...  X
23/10/2014, 20:39 - Big Ran: But was triggered because I tried to fix her phone and broke it more x
23/10/2014, 20:40 - abigailcoe: Ohhh. But that's not so much you doing too much for her rather than you just loving fixing stuff x
23/10/2014, 20:40 - abigailcoe: It's always nicer to do stuff for other people x
23/10/2014, 20:40 - Big Ran: Yeah I know but it is also true,  I do lots of things for other people and don't do my work, easing, cooking, cleaning etc
23/10/2014, 20:41 - Big Ran: But I do love fixing this,  although I do hate breaking things,  always get that horrible stomach thing x
23/10/2014, 20:42 - abigailcoe: Yeah, that blows x
23/10/2014, 20:42 - Big Ran: I started watching some new things though,  blackish and modern family x
23/10/2014, 20:42 - abigailcoe: Blackish?x
23/10/2014, 20:43 - abigailcoe: Would you recommend either?
23/10/2014, 20:43 - Big Ran: Yeah its about a middle class black family,  I would recommend both for easy watching  x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - abigailcoe: I tried modern family. But not very hard.x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - abigailcoe: I like the sound of blackish x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - Big Ran: Oh and I watched one episode of middle which again for easy watching x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - abigailcoe: Never heard of it x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - Big Ran: Ignore the pilot though,  it gets better x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - Big Ran: Oh yeah nor had i x
23/10/2014, 20:44 - abigailcoe: Of blackish? X
23/10/2014, 20:45 - Big Ran: I think modern family is the hardest one x
23/10/2014, 20:45 - Big Ran: None of them,  though I had seen the blackish banner
23/10/2014, 20:45 - abigailcoe: No, ignore the pilot of which one?x
23/10/2014, 20:46 - Big Ran: Oh sorry yeah blackish
23/10/2014, 20:47 - Big Ran: Modern family I have not really got into yet but im going to persevere because of the amount of mentions of arrested development in the reviews x
23/10/2014, 20:48 - abigailcoe: People seem to LOVE it. I usually just assume that's because they are stupid.x
23/10/2014, 20:50 - Big Ran: Good point,  I got suckered into all three because I read reviews and forgot that point x
23/10/2014, 20:50 - Big Ran: But the other two were just what I needed at the time x
23/10/2014, 20:55 - abigailcoe: I'll definitely try them, I have fuck all to watch right now. Re-watching old stuff can be pretty boring.x
23/10/2014, 21:00 - abigailcoe: Kasper just lent me an Oliver Sacks book!x
23/10/2014, 21:03 - abigailcoe: And a special edition of a magazine about Buddhism and psychedelics. I swear, this guy gets weirder and weirder by the day.x
23/10/2014, 21:05 - abigailcoe: Also, I hate how my keyboard puts in spaces after brackets and hyphens and shit x
23/10/2014, 21:14 - Big Ran: Yeah I know ,  I was trying to write a Web address the other day and had to resort to airdroid as it was impossible x
23/10/2014, 21:15 - Big Ran: I'm sure there is a way of turning it off but I couldn't find it in the short time i had x
23/10/2014, 21:47 - abigailcoe: Oh my god, my building has a rubbish chute. X
23/10/2014, 21:56 - Big Ran: Haha amassing.  That's good for when you need to get rid of someone who overstays their welcome x
23/10/2014, 21:58 - abigailcoe: Or just impulse getting rid of stuff that you feel guilty about throwing away. Because there's no going back.x
23/10/2014, 21:59 - Big Ran: Haha true,  I need one if those x
23/10/2014, 21:59 - abigailcoe: Oh Aran, this is all too weird. I was aware that Kasper has left some stuff under the bed, but I was not ready for dirty boys pants ( yes, pants) on one side
23/10/2014, 21:59 - abigailcoe: And to match, dirty girl pants on the other. Yuck. X
23/10/2014, 22:00 - Big Ran: Oh god,  that is definitely 3 steps too far  x
23/10/2014, 22:02 - abigailcoe: I must say, I'm quite surprised in managing to hold myself together. I don't think I would have managed this without a breakdown a year or so ago x
23/10/2014, 22:02 - abigailcoe: Thanks for letting me ramble at you xx
23/10/2014, 22:03 - Big Ran: Hehe true,  I was thinking about stuff like that today,  bad stuff brings good things x
23/10/2014, 22:03 - abigailcoe: Huh?
23/10/2014, 22:04 - Big Ran: Just having known how bad it can get can help you hold it together x
23/10/2014, 22:04 - abigailcoe: That is true x
23/10/2014, 22:04 - Big Ran: Because it's external stuff mostly ,  like the breaking down thing x
23/10/2014, 22:04 - abigailcoe: What part is external?x
23/10/2014, 22:06 - Big Ran: The things,  like the things it's him doing the stuff that could make you feel shitty but it's not because your alright x
23/10/2014, 22:07 - abigailcoe: Haha, I don't get it, but that's ok. That sentence doesn't make a lot of sense to me x
23/10/2014, 22:07 - Big Ran: What I mean is like the thing you told me about breaking down in the car x
23/10/2014, 22:08 - abigailcoe: Oh that thing! Got confused because I said breakdown a little earlier, in the fall apart and cry way x
23/10/2014, 22:10 - abigailcoe: It's all an exciting adventure, that's what it is. Just this adventure is a bit gross. And annoying because he should have taken all his stuff away. Actually, it's not like the car thing, but that's not the point x
23/10/2014, 22:13 - Big Ran: Hehe maybe I missed the point of the story,  or at least forgot x
23/10/2014, 22:14 - abigailcoe: It is kind of similar, but with the car stuff, there's nothing you can do. When you're interacting with the person who's rented their room to you but left it full off native American artefacts and dirty pants, it's different x
23/10/2014, 22:15 - Big Ran: Arrgh I better try and sleep,  i'm not keen on this really morning business   x
23/10/2014, 22:15 - abigailcoe: I know, I'm sorry, I've been meaning to tell you do to that for a bit x
23/10/2014, 22:15 - abigailcoe: Sleep well sweet xx
23/10/2014, 22:16 - Big Ran: Oh ok I see what you mean,  it's worse because you get the 'I should do something about this'  voices x
23/10/2014, 22:16 - Big Ran: Night night lovely,  i'm excited for hearing more stories soon x
23/10/2014, 22:16 - abigailcoe: Yeah. Or "he should do something about this" too
23/10/2014, 22:16 - abigailcoe: Xx
23/10/2014, 22:17 - Big Ran: Haha yeah .  What an idiot x
24/10/2014, 11:16 - abigailcoe: Elementary season 3 30th October! X
25/10/2014, 15:49 - Big Ran: How's things going love,  got any weirder ? X
25/10/2014, 15:50 - abigailcoe: Not yet, they might do though, he's coming round in a bit. X
25/10/2014, 15:51 - abigailcoe: Got super drunk at rich's last night, and this morning I spat some bacon out when I laughed and that made me laugh so hard that I cried, again. X
25/10/2014, 15:53 - Big Ran: Haha that's hilarious x
25/10/2014, 15:53 - abigailcoe: Too too hilarious. So embarrassing.x
25/10/2014, 16:24 - abigailcoe: Oh my god I just linked it up! Molly from the yurt is going out with your friend, Paul Sterry!x
25/10/2014, 16:25 - Big Ran: No way! That is mental x
25/10/2014, 16:26 - Big Ran: How did you link that up? X
25/10/2014, 16:26 - abigailcoe: She posted a new profile picture with sterry creative url under it, and little bells rang in my head....x
25/10/2014, 16:27 - Big Ran: Oooh, crazy shit x
25/10/2014, 16:27 - abigailcoe: Cray cray. You love him, right? He's a good guy?x
25/10/2014, 16:28 - Big Ran: He's the one that makes everyone cry,  but he is a nice guy,  when not pissed x
25/10/2014, 16:29 - abigailcoe: Makes everyone cry??x
25/10/2014, 16:29 - Big Ran: Yeah,  he has a habit of being an even bigger dick then steve x
25/10/2014, 16:29 - abigailcoe: Wow.x
25/10/2014, 16:29 - abigailcoe: Well she's a dick too, so that works xx
25/10/2014, 16:30 - Big Ran: Haha yeah,  and karens new guy is really nice so everyone is happy x
25/10/2014, 16:30 - abigailcoe: Haha, great x
25/10/2014, 16:33 - abigailcoe: Giffgaff don't charge for 0800 numbers??!! X
25/10/2014, 16:33 - Big Ran: Nope x
25/10/2014, 16:33 - abigailcoe: Amaze x
25/10/2014, 16:34 - Big Ran: I know,  is great,  Olivia has converted too x
26/10/2014, 16:54 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
26/10/2014, 18:01 - abigailcoe: What the fuck is that?
26/10/2014, 18:02 - abigailcoe: Hippies.
26/10/2014, 18:02 - abigailcoe: Xxx
26/10/2014, 20:16 - Big Ran: Haha yeah it's Olivia's,  I took the piss at first but now it's memorised me a bit x
28/10/2014, 09:53 - abigailcoe: You working today? X
28/10/2014, 09:58 - Big Ran: Nope,  got lots of reading to do and Ben and Ben are coming for lunch.  You in Bristol? X
28/10/2014, 10:16 - abigailcoe: Just doing the last empty of the unit, quick cup of tea before I go back?x
28/10/2014, 10:17 - Big Ran: Yep sure,  I'm at home x
28/10/2014, 10:17 - abigailcoe: Cool, I'm guessing within the hour x
28/10/2014, 20:28 - abigailcoe: I just saw a trailer for the middle. It looks amazing. I'm fully on board. X
29/10/2014, 17:03 - abigailcoe: Interview at Hawksmoor tomorrow evening, woo scared! X
29/10/2014, 17:26 - Big Ran: Scary but niiice one! X
29/10/2014, 22:07 - abigailcoe: Remember my round teapot with the chrome cosy? You can buy the same ones, in Selfridges, stamped with a fancy (very very nice) French teamaker's logo for ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE POUNDS.X
30/10/2014, 18:10 - Big Ran: Fuuuuck! Crazy bastards x
30/10/2014, 18:11 - Big Ran: It's killing me this once a week thing for serial.  I want it all at once dammit x
30/10/2014, 18:12 - Big Ran: How did your interview go? X
30/10/2014, 19:19 - abigailcoe: Just finished! I think it went alright, they asked me to stay and shadow someone for half an hour which can't be bad. Find out on Sunday.xx
30/10/2014, 20:25 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
31/10/2014, 11:24 - abigailcoe: A parcel delivery man dropped some stuff off for the neighbours, he's got a special secret key that gives him access to all the big blocks of flats! Amazing. X
31/10/2014, 13:28 - abigailcoe: Hahaha, Harry's status x
31/10/2014, 13:30 - Big Ran: What dutty ken? X
31/10/2014, 13:31 - abigailcoe: Dutty ken?x
31/10/2014, 13:33 - Big Ran: What's his status? X
31/10/2014, 13:33 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
31/10/2014, 13:34 - abigailcoe: Big the picture up, obvs x
31/10/2014, 13:34 - Big Ran: Whaaaat haha oh dear
31/10/2014, 13:35 - abigailcoe: I know! Hahaha so bad x
31/10/2014, 17:10 - Big Ran: Elementary is out x
31/10/2014, 17:40 - abigailcoe: Wicked x
01/11/2014, 21:49 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
01/11/2014, 21:50 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
01/11/2014, 21:52 - Big Ran: The first one x
01/11/2014, 21:53 - abigailcoe: Really? I didn't expect that x
01/11/2014, 21:56 - Big Ran: Yeah definitely,  mostly based on the fact that it's more stylish and Halloween is in October,  although obviously it runs till today a bit x
01/11/2014, 22:00 - Big Ran: So you think the bloody one?
01/11/2014, 22:01 - abigailcoe: I was leaning towards it. I think it's funny. X
01/11/2014, 22:02 - Big Ran: No time for comedy now your in the serious city x
01/11/2014, 22:03 - Big Ran: Now is all about being pretentious and wanky x
01/11/2014, 22:04 - abigailcoe: Fuck that shit. You're gonna make me want to come home if you carry on like that. Stop it. I'm very hungover and vulnerable right now. X
01/11/2014, 22:06 - Big Ran: Hehe me too.  Nah I seriously like the first one best.  And it is funny in its own way x
01/11/2014, 22:08 - Big Ran: Can't you use both? Or have a vote x
01/11/2014, 22:10 - abigailcoe: Both? That's insane. I just asked Karen and she said zombie waitress is hilarious but Bethnal Green is SEX. So in the interests of boys, I should do that one.x
02/11/2014, 17:36 - abigailcoe: I got the job!!! Xx
02/11/2014, 17:37 - Big Ran: Amazing.  Well on your way to sustaining greatness x
02/11/2014, 18:36 - Big Ran: Oh yeah apparently Harry's status was for him.  His new house is cold and loud and damp and not very social.  I think he is slowly learning from mistakes x
02/11/2014, 18:37 - Big Ran: When do you start? X
02/11/2014, 18:40 - abigailcoe: Wow, so he's just bailing? He didn't get kicked out? X
02/11/2014, 18:40 - abigailcoe: They're letting me name my start date, which is insane to me xx
03/11/2014, 10:13 - abigailcoe: I keep thinking about Carla's two teapots. No way can she get out of that one.x
03/11/2014, 11:27 - Big Ran: I dunno,  she has managed so far but only if you minus jewellery from the equation x
03/11/2014, 11:35 - abigailcoe: She doesn't have to accept it in order for it to be true x
03/11/2014, 11:36 - Big Ran: Oh you mean literally the two teapots? X
03/11/2014, 11:40 - Big Ran: Also have you donated a dollar yet? You totally should (I've been sucked in)
03/11/2014, 11:42 - abigailcoe: I donated to the first two, and the first time he said it would be the only time he'd ever do a kickstarter, and the second time he said it'd be the last time he'd ever do a kickstarter. I'm not donating in protest because of his lies.x
03/11/2014, 11:42 - abigailcoe: Yeah, literally the teapots!x
03/11/2014, 11:42 - Big Ran: Haha ok fair enough,  I didn't on those x
03/11/2014, 11:43 - abigailcoe: I don't think he'll get 20,000 backers x
03/11/2014, 11:43 - abigailcoe: Or it'll be fucking close x
03/11/2014, 11:43 - Big Ran: Nah I don't count them,  it's not enough for me.  If it was a teapot collection but not just two x
03/11/2014, 11:43 - abigailcoe: You came up with it though!x
03/11/2014, 11:43 - Big Ran: I don't either but it is so close x
03/11/2014, 11:44 - abigailcoe: No it's not! X
03/11/2014, 11:45 - Big Ran: I know but I have thought a lot about it and I just think,  it's like plates,  you always have more plates and cups then you use at once,  so that when you have people over then you have enough x
03/11/2014, 11:46 - abigailcoe: So you think she'll make two pots of tea at once at some point? Guaranteed that wasn't what she was thinking when she was buying the second one x
03/11/2014, 11:47 - Big Ran: Yeah probably not.  I think I'll have to investigate the back story of the teapots a bit more.  Haha x
03/11/2014, 11:54 - abigailcoe: Haha,I don't know why I care so much about everything x
03/11/2014, 13:49 - abigailcoe: Fuuuuuuck! I just met my landlady and she's having to sell the flat, she wants me to move out asap.
03/11/2014, 13:49 - abigailcoe: Hahahahahahahahaaaa fml. X
03/11/2014, 16:34 - Big Ran: Ahhh no! That's mega shit x
03/11/2014, 16:40 - Big Ran: Fuuuuck! Those bastards.  All of them x
03/11/2014, 16:59 - abigailcoe: Ahh, it's fine. It's pretty funny xx
03/11/2014, 17:01 - Big Ran: You know what's not fine.
Absorb, absorbed, absorbing, absorber,  absorbable,  absorbability,  absorbency,  absorbedly and  absorbingly but ABSORPTION!  Why?
03/11/2014, 17:12 - abigailcoe: Hahahaha! That's what we call the English language x
04/11/2014, 12:16 - Big Ran: Did you ever pay me for factory cottage? There is no panic if not I'm just doing a financial check of everything I owe and am owed and i have it written down but that doesn't mean much x
04/11/2014, 13:02 - abigailcoe: Honestly, I have no idea. I assume I did at the time but have no recollection whatsoever. Stick it on my tab if you will xx
04/11/2014, 15:52 - abigailcoe: I still don't know what my wage is gonna be, but the average for front of house staff at Hawksmoor is 26k. Oh yeah. X
04/11/2014, 15:54 - Big Ran: Niiice.  Your goods be alright x
05/11/2014, 13:17 - abigailcoe: I love when you think something's gonna be a massive pain in the ass, and it turns out to be super easy xx
05/11/2014, 13:42 - abigailcoe: Yosemite?x
05/11/2014, 14:25 - Big Ran: You found new digs? X
05/11/2014, 14:25 - Big Ran: I did look into yosemite and i will try it out but I'm not keen on change x
05/11/2014, 14:26 - abigailcoe: Haha, no. I went to view a place yesterday, but they'd let it in the half hour it took me to get there x
05/11/2014, 14:26 - abigailcoe: Just getting my academic transcript from uni was super easy x
05/11/2014, 15:07 - Big Ran: I don't know really what that is but it sounds very useful and in glad it was easy x
05/11/2014, 15:12 - abigailcoe: It's a list of all your modules and grades. X
05/11/2014, 17:22 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
05/11/2014, 17:26 - abigailcoe: Hahaha, weird x
07/11/2014, 23:09 - abigailcoe: Have you been watching detectorists? I find it weirdly compulsive. It's kind of depressing and reassuring st the same time. I always want to turn it off but then I feel bad when I do. X
07/11/2014, 23:09 - abigailcoe: And are you getting the blue ticks yet?x
07/11/2014, 23:10 - Big Ran: Hmmm.  That's all I can say right now x
07/11/2014, 23:11 - abigailcoe: Ok good. Love you.xx
07/11/2014, 23:13 - Big Ran: Love you too London crew dem x
08/11/2014, 14:04 - Big Ran: It's weird,  I updated WhatsApp on thursday I think but didn't get blue rocks til today x
08/11/2014, 14:05 - Big Ran: Does it mean Facebook have stolen the message? X
08/11/2014, 14:08 - Big Ran: Ohhh i see.  They are paying that game eh x
08/11/2014, 14:09 - Big Ran: I haven't seen detectorists,  I will have a look x
08/11/2014, 14:23 - abigailcoe: It seems random who's getting blue ticks and who isn't, I can't make any sense of it x
08/11/2014, 14:24 - abigailcoe: What were you up to last night?x
08/11/2014, 14:27 - Big Ran: I think you both have to have updated WhatsApp for it to work x
08/11/2014, 14:28 - abigailcoe: Hmmm, I guess that makes sense x
08/11/2014, 14:28 - Big Ran: I think actually I didn't see it yesteryear because you hadnt read it yet x
08/11/2014, 14:28 - Big Ran: Just drank gin and had dinner then went to the plough x
08/11/2014, 14:28 - abigailcoe: Uh, I think I had x
08/11/2014, 14:29 - abigailcoe: Ah, gin. I smoked weed last week haha x
08/11/2014, 14:29 - Big Ran: Haha no way! Was it fun? X
08/11/2014, 14:32 - abigailcoe: Yeah it was! I only had a bit but I enjoyed myself x
09/11/2014, 00:55 - abigailcoe: Adam Buxton loves Rick and Morty x

09/11/2014, 12:58 - abigailcoe: http://thenerve.us/blog/shia-labeouf/
10/11/2014, 20:09 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
10/11/2014, 23:49 - Big Ran: Haha I reckon he would start with the Pope x
12/11/2014, 11:05 - Big Ran: Now that I have wasted my time watching nearly all the episodes of the middle I can say it is a load of rubbish but watchable.  And they stole the story about the tiny dolls house dining table x
12/11/2014, 20:47 - abigailcoe: It's a low rent Malcolm in the middle. So obvious. But yeah, totally watchable. I don't remember the tiny dining table story! X
12/11/2014, 21:23 - Big Ran: I can't remember what podcast it was but someone ordered  what they thought was a bargain price dining table and chairs but it turned out to be dolls house furniture.  I thought you told me about it,  probably this American life.  How's things going? X
13/11/2014, 16:24 - abigailcoe: Oh yeah, I think it was this American life. Things are fine, feeling a bit rubbish today but oh well. Looking for houses is shit. How are you? X
13/11/2014, 18:17 - Big Ran: Yeah I'm good,  tired as usual but generally good x
13/11/2014, 20:57 - abigailcoe: I need a hug 😓 x
13/11/2014, 22:27 - abigailcoe: You know electric Whatsapp hugs are better than nothing x
13/11/2014, 22:33 - Big Ran: Haha true 💆i can't find hugs though,  how about a head massage? X
13/11/2014, 22:35 - Big Ran: I miss you.  When are you coming to visit? X
13/11/2014, 22:41 - abigailcoe: 🙆 maybe solo head hug is the one x
13/11/2014, 22:42 - abigailcoe: I miss you too. Might come back for a little while Tuesday or Wednesday, waiting to hear back from your bird x
13/11/2014, 22:43 - Big Ran: Oh yeah.  Can't believe they don't have the pillow cocoon.  Fools! X
13/11/2014, 22:43 - abigailcoe: What you doing?x
13/11/2014, 22:44 - Big Ran: Going to sleep.  Come on Tuesday I think x
13/11/2014, 22:45 - Big Ran: I'm re listening to Adam and Joe again x
13/11/2014, 22:45 - abigailcoe: Nice. Sleep well sweet x
13/11/2014, 22:45 - Big Ran: You to lovely,  I'll call you soon xx
15/11/2014, 17:53 - abigailcoe: Oh God, Kieran just texted me, he's pissed off, thinks I'm freaking out like before. Ugh x

17/11/2014, 23:35 - Big Ran: I am working but only till about 3 most likely x
18/11/2014, 11:13 - abigailcoe: Do you know where ely's studio is? Of course you do. Will you tell me please?x
18/11/2014, 11:25 - Big Ran: Yes I most certainly will tell you x
18/11/2014, 11:26 - Big Ran: You gonna come Wednesday morning? X
18/11/2014, 11:32 - Big Ran: It's in the old police station bit of the island x
18/11/2014, 11:37 - abigailcoe: Oh, nice and central, good.x
18/11/2014, 11:37 - abigailcoe: Yeah I think so. Might get the train because I'm too pooped to be bothered with driving x
18/11/2014, 11:38 - Big Ran: Yeah fair enough. Get to watch this too x

18/11/2014, 11:39 - Big Ran: Oh that was meant to be things x
18/11/2014, 11:39 - Big Ran: Stupid phone
18/11/2014, 11:39 - abigailcoe: Haha yep x
18/11/2014, 14:19 - abigailcoe: Have you listened to the this American life about the girl who was pen pals with noriaga? Insane x
18/11/2014, 14:44 - Big Ran: Yeah I think I did but I don't remember the story specifically x
18/11/2014, 15:46 - abigailcoe: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B2XkqYvCMAA7Me0.png:large
18/11/2014, 15:46 - abigailcoe: Mail kimp girl did it x
18/11/2014, 16:33 - Big Ran: Haha. Is that Dana? X
18/11/2014, 16:34 - abigailcoe: Dana? It's the girl on the trail at the start x
18/11/2014, 16:34 - Big Ran: Oh I see. Yeah I don't think she is clever enough if she can't say chimp x
18/11/2014, 16:34 - abigailcoe: Haha, yeah x
18/11/2014, 16:35 - Big Ran: I think it's Dana who says oh do you blah blah. Or I'm just confused x
18/11/2014, 16:35 - abigailcoe: Oh that one! I like that bit x
19/11/2014, 16:26 - abigailcoe: Where you at? I'm currently sitting on the floor outside caro's house. She's not at home. X
19/11/2014, 16:27 - Big Ran: Im at home . Wheres Caro s? X
19/11/2014, 16:27 - abigailcoe: Chesterfield road x

19/11/2014, 16:28 - abigailcoe: Shall I walk over?x
19/11/2014, 16:28 - Big Ran: Yesh come
19/11/2014, 16:29 - abigailcoe: Cool, I'm on the move x
19/11/2014, 22:29 - abigailcoe: Just got back on the tube. I'm glad I moved here, it's like I've sloughed off my old skin. Got a call back from the house in Stepney, going to meet the other person on Saturday, yay. So good to see you today xxx
19/11/2014, 22:57 - Big Ran: That's really good,  I'm so glad your glad.  Was really good to see you too xx
22/11/2014, 18:48 - abigailcoe: You know when your keyboard suggests the next word? I've now got: la la la oh yeah do a dance programmed. Winning. Also, I'm moving to Stepney woo woo x
24/11/2014, 11:00 - abigailcoe: How was the party?x
24/11/2014, 13:41 - Big Ran: It was mostly fun.  Really posting for it now though. How was the wedding? X
24/11/2014, 13:59 - abigailcoe: Why only mostly? #secretwedding was brilliant, so lush. Met the funniest man, his email is jesuschrist@gmail.com, he gets messages from crazies every day, it's amazing x
24/11/2014, 15:14 - Big Ran: Oh just the usual twats out staying their welcome at the end of the night.  And i feel a bit dead inside but there is still a little time to recover before my actual birthday.  That guy sounds hilarious.  Good news about the flat too xx
24/11/2014, 16:03 - Big Ran: Was the wedding a secret? I want to see pictures of you in your dress xx
24/11/2014, 23:44 - abigailcoe: It was secret, yeah, social media blackout and everything, so I haven't got any pictures, could be a while before any official ones come out x
27/11/2014, 13:16 - abigailcoe: Happy birthday love, I hope you're baking that pie and not instead cursing thanksgiving for taking serial away from us this week xx
27/11/2014, 19:12 - Big Ran: Haha yeah I am actually still a bit annoyed about thanks giving.  But pie is in the oven so all is good xx
28/11/2014, 18:14 - Big Ran: They fixed my phone under warranty.  Yay! but they wiped it.  Poo heads xx
28/11/2014, 20:10 - abigailcoe: Yay! Ohhh. Xx
28/11/2014, 21:53 - abigailcoe: Did you get the 4g goodybag? I can't really tell the difference x
28/11/2014, 21:58 - Big Ran: Nah its only in Ashton here x
28/11/2014, 22:00 - abigailcoe: Whaaat?! I thought Bristol was one of the pilot cities?x
28/11/2014, 22:01 - Big Ran: I'm not sure.  It might be being piloted just in Ashton x
28/11/2014, 22:04 - abigailcoe: That is random as hell. I know a couple of people in Bristol who've had 4g for years. Although to be fair the map does have a lot more 'good outdoors' than just Ashton x
28/11/2014, 22:18 - Big Ran: Oh right.  When i looked it just had there.  Maybe I will try it x
01/12/2014, 10:27 - Big Ran: How are you love? Have you found out about whether you have Saturday off yet? X
01/12/2014, 10:28 - abigailcoe: I'm horrendously hungover and moving house. I hate myself. X
01/12/2014, 10:29 - abigailcoe: Can't get it off 😭 xx
01/12/2014, 10:29 - Big Ran: Oh poo.  On all accounts x
01/12/2014, 10:29 - Big Ran: I hate myself too x
01/12/2014, 10:29 - abigailcoe: Oh no! Why?x
01/12/2014, 10:30 - Big Ran: Oh just had the worst week ever last week.  Come down anger depression etc x
01/12/2014, 10:31 - abigailcoe: Oh shit! That's horrible xx
01/12/2014, 10:31 - Big Ran: Nothing actually happened,  just shitty x
01/12/2014, 10:31 - abigailcoe: Oh babe, wish I could give you a hug x
01/12/2014, 10:31 - Big Ran: Me too. Xx
01/12/2014, 18:08 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
01/12/2014, 18:12 - abigailcoe: I've got to learn how to use this projector like yesterday
01/12/2014, 18:19 - Big Ran: What projector? X
01/12/2014, 18:20 - Big Ran: And who has garden weeds? X
01/12/2014, 18:21 - abigailcoe: The one in my new house x
01/12/2014, 18:21 - abigailcoe: And I now have garden weeds x
01/12/2014, 18:21 - Big Ran: Oh yeah x haha score
01/12/2014, 18:21 - abigailcoe: I know! So good x
01/12/2014, 18:21 - Big Ran: It'll be easy,  the projector I mean x
01/12/2014, 18:22 - abigailcoe: Hope so. I think I better wait till he gets gone and ask rather than just messing about with it x
01/12/2014, 18:23 - Big Ran: Yeah that's definitely the right way round x
01/12/2014, 19:05 - Big Ran: Check out 99 pallets. Com x
01/12/2014, 19:09 - abigailcoe: Haha, I thought you meant it was a comedy show x
01/12/2014, 19:09 - abigailcoe: Nice pallets. What you gonna make?
01/12/2014, 19:10 - Big Ran: Garden bench.  Not sure which design yet x
02/12/2014, 19:43 - abigailcoe: Can I ask a favour please? Would you mind picking up a prescription on Thursday for me from malago and sticking it in the post? X
02/12/2014, 19:51 - Big Ran: Yeah of course if i'm allowed to xx
02/12/2014, 19:52 - abigailcoe: I think you should be, Oscar picked up a prescription for me when I had swine flu. Good times. The address will be 12A Chessel Street. Thank you x
02/12/2014, 19:53 - Big Ran: Ok cool,  that's fine.  How are you? All moved n that? X
02/12/2014, 19:54 - abigailcoe: I just looked it up, I'll have to tell them that you're coming to get it, but it should be fine otherwise x
02/12/2014, 19:55 - abigailcoe: All moved! Not organised at all yet, but at least my bed is made now. X
02/12/2014, 19:56 - abigailcoe: Kieran just texted me that he's bought me a Christmas present, and he needs my address, even though we're supposed to meet up soon to swap clothes. I'm hella confused x
02/12/2014, 19:57 - Big Ran: What? That's all a bit weird.  Buuuut getting things in the post is fun x
02/12/2014, 19:58 - abigailcoe: It is weird, isn't it. Dunno why he's bought me a present after all that. And even if he bought it before, why not just send it back?x
04/12/2014, 13:55 - abigailcoe: Doctors say it's fine for you to pick the script up x
04/12/2014, 14:14 - Big Ran: On cool ,  I'm not sure I'm going to have time to go today though as I've got to go to my doctor at lunch.  Well wheezy xx
05/12/2014, 09:38 - abigailcoe: How's your wheeze today? X
05/12/2014, 09:39 - abigailcoe: I lost my fag so started smoking real cigarettes yesterday. So fucking rank. X
05/12/2014, 10:14 - Big Ran: Ow no that's not a good move but it is good to hear that it's real as i was considering it xx
05/12/2014, 10:15 - Big Ran: Still mega wheezy,  doctor prescribed me antibiotics and steroids.  Haven't got them yet though xx
05/12/2014, 10:15 - abigailcoe: Don't do it. My whole head hurts. X
05/12/2014, 10:15 - Big Ran: I should be able to pick up your thing today x
05/12/2014, 10:16 - abigailcoe: Go and get your prescription now! X
05/12/2014, 10:16 - abigailcoe: What did he say the wheeze was from?x
05/12/2014, 10:16 - abigailcoe: And that would be amazing, thank you, I'm running so low x
05/12/2014, 10:17 - Big Ran: Don't know what it is,  got to go to bri and get tested for ashma x
05/12/2014, 10:18 - Big Ran: Should I post it or give it to helen? X
05/12/2014, 10:18 - abigailcoe: Well that seems like a super obviously cause. Can't believe I didn't think of that before x
05/12/2014, 10:18 - abigailcoe: Post please. Are you coming up tomorrow? X
05/12/2014, 10:24 - Big Ran: Yeah I'm coming after work,  straight to kitson xx
05/12/2014, 10:25 - Big Ran: I thought I had been tested for ashma but turns out not xx

05/12/2014, 10:26 - abigailcoe: Put it in the post then please, 52 redmans road, Stepney Green, e1 3aq xx
05/12/2014, 10:26 - abigailcoe: Fingers crossed for asthma?x
05/12/2014, 10:27 - Big Ran: Yeah I guess.  At least there's drugs for that xx
06/12/2014, 14:02 - abigailcoe: Did you get the prescription sweet? X
06/12/2014, 14:30 - Big Ran: Yes u did but was too late to post yesterday.  Ill bring it and  post in london xx
06/12/2014, 14:37 - abigailcoe: Thanks love xx
07/12/2014, 15:51 - abigailcoe: How was Daniel? X
07/12/2014, 18:31 - Big Ran: He was really good.  Not stand up,  another story about Christmas xx
07/12/2014, 21:48 - abigailcoe: Oh my God, postman, I've got a post dilemma. I ordered a new fag, but by mistake it's being sent to chessel street. Is there anything I can do? X
07/12/2014, 21:48 - abigailcoe: So annoyed x
07/12/2014, 21:49 - Big Ran: Hmm not really if it's already sent.  Unless it gets carded xx
07/12/2014, 21:50 - abigailcoe: What does carded mean?x
07/12/2014, 21:50 - abigailcoe: And what happens if they can't deliver it and nobody picks it up at the office?x
07/12/2014, 21:50 - abigailcoe: Sorry for being a postal spaz xx
07/12/2014, 21:55 - Big Ran: That's what I mean by carded.  You could have it re delivered to your house in London if that happens.  I think x
07/12/2014, 21:56 - Big Ran: Did you order it from fast tech? X
07/12/2014, 22:26 - abigailcoe: Nope, smokshop x
07/12/2014, 22:27 - abigailcoe: Bought all the stuff, wanted it quick and at the same time x
07/12/2014, 22:27 - abigailcoe: Even got a mini pro tank3 x
07/12/2014, 22:28 - abigailcoe: I don't suppose you know if I can tell if that has happened or not? It's got tracking x
07/12/2014, 22:31 - abigailcoe: At what point does a redirect happen?x
07/12/2014, 22:31 - abigailcoe: Oh, forget that actually, I'm being insane x
07/12/2014, 23:00 - abigailcoe: Just wanted to say to someone, without judgement, and not asking for sympathy, honestly, this whole week has just been a massive fml week. Worked so much, cried quite a lot, tried not to cry at work but occasionally failed at even that, whilst not telling anyone why I was sad because it would open the door to more crying, stuff in piles in my tiny room, lost my beautiful cigarette, so unbelievably tired, being pissed around by Kieran not letting me just tidy it all up and move along. Weirdly, about the best thing at the moment is the adhd tinder rebound, who I call angry boy, because he always makes me tea when I go to his house and we watch tv and his pillows are really comfy. And if he leaves before I do in the morning, he leaves the heating on for me and gets me a clean towel. X
07/12/2014, 23:01 - abigailcoe: I'll be ok, mind x
08/12/2014, 09:12 - Big Ran: I know you will. Are you working today? Maybe we could facetime xx
08/12/2014, 10:18 - abigailcoe: Working til 9 tonight x
08/12/2014, 11:48 - Big Ran: Boooooo.  Big hugs.  Call me in your break if you feel like xx
08/12/2014, 23:59 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
09/12/2014, 01:08 - Big Ran: Hahaha naughty McDonald's

09/12/2014, 01:10 - Big Ran: Oh no.  Wait is that a good thing? Not about sleeping obvs x
09/12/2014, 01:10 - Big Ran: I can't either x
09/12/2014, 01:10 - abigailcoe: Yes it is good! Then I can get a refund or just get them to post it here x
09/12/2014, 01:11 - abigailcoe: The man who lives in my old flat is a postman, he must have known with his posting ways x
09/12/2014, 01:11 - abigailcoe: Why can't you sleep?x
09/12/2014, 01:11 - Big Ran: Ah brilliant.  Where did you get it from? I need a new one too x
09/12/2014, 01:12 - Big Ran: I'm watching the american version of the returned x
09/12/2014, 01:12 - abigailcoe: Smokshop. But vapeland do them for twenty quid x
09/12/2014, 01:12 - abigailcoe: Is it good?x
09/12/2014, 01:13 - Big Ran: Ooo vapeland.  Sounds like the pound land of vaping x
09/12/2014, 01:13 - Big Ran: Hmmm.  Is just like every other American mystery type thing.  So so x
09/12/2014, 01:13 - abigailcoe: Hahaha, true. They're what Matt and Laurie use. Their post is slower but I'm not arguing with twenty notes x
09/12/2014, 01:14 - abigailcoe: I started watching supernatural. I quite like it x
09/12/2014, 01:15 - abigailcoe: Also, I left out the end of the story about the murdered hairdresser. Angry boy's mum kept her hair short. It's still short now. She likes it.x
09/12/2014, 01:16 - Big Ran: Hahaha classic. That's funny.  Apart from the being killed bit x
09/12/2014, 01:17 - abigailcoe: I know, it's awful, but I've laughed about that story pretty much every time I've told it. Which is quite a lot of times x
09/12/2014, 01:18 - Big Ran: I really wanted to like Supernatural.  But i just never got into it.  Oh no actually I might be thinking of something else x
09/12/2014, 01:18 - Big Ran: What was that program you watched that started in the woods? With supernatural things in it? X
09/12/2014, 01:18 - abigailcoe: Started in the woods? Going to need more than that x
09/12/2014, 01:19 - Big Ran: Ah I can't remember.  I think maybe it was that one x
09/12/2014, 01:19 - Big Ran: Does it start in the woods?
09/12/2014, 01:19 - abigailcoe: I watched two episodes from the tenth series, and that was enough to make me want to watch it from the start. It does kind of happy lighting like Chuck. Most of the time x
09/12/2014, 01:20 - abigailcoe: Do you mean the credits or the pilot?x
09/12/2014, 01:20 - Big Ran: The pilot x
09/12/2014, 01:20 - abigailcoe: Nope, it does not start in the woods x
09/12/2014, 01:21 - abigailcoe: But I really want to know what did now x
09/12/2014, 01:21 - Big Ran: Oh.  Don't know what I'm thinking of then but I think I have watched some of that too.  I seem to remember is pretty ridiculous x
09/12/2014, 01:22 - Big Ran: Fringe! x
09/12/2014, 01:22 - abigailcoe: Oh fringe! I forgot about that! Love that shit x
09/12/2014, 01:22 - abigailcoe: Couldn't get past series2 though x
09/12/2014, 01:23 - abigailcoe: I think it is ridiculous but when people get super geek about a show that runs for so long, I feel like it must be worth it somehow x
09/12/2014, 01:24 - Big Ran: Yeah I guess.  Maybe it's like buffy x
09/12/2014, 01:24 - abigailcoe: That's a good example. Nice work x
09/12/2014, 01:25 - abigailcoe: Why are you not sleeping?z

09/12/2014, 01:31 - Big Ran: Dammit and im already too late for most of the ones I want x
09/12/2014, 01:31 - abigailcoe: Sounds like you're becoming another one of those trainers geeks x
09/12/2014, 01:32 - abigailcoe: Haha,,  you have to be on it at midnight! I'm an old hand x
09/12/2014, 01:32 - Big Ran: Not really but it's just I always just thought they would just make skate trainers the same  x
09/12/2014, 01:33 - abigailcoe: Not in the stupid modern world x
09/12/2014, 01:33 - Big Ran: I just wanted the same ones I had when I was 14.  Turns out they haven't made then since I was 14 x
09/12/2014, 01:33 - abigailcoe: Haha, oh no, that's sad x
09/12/2014, 01:34 - Big Ran: I know and the new ones by the same guy are shit and vegan x

05/01/2015, 20:10 - Big Ran: She phoned me yesterday and I could hear all the little frogs and crickets x
05/01/2015, 20:10 - abigailcoe: But better than this x
05/01/2015, 20:10 - abigailcoe: No way! That's amazing x
05/01/2015, 20:11 - Big Ran: Which bit better? Not working silly hours? X
05/01/2015, 20:11 - abigailcoe: No, that's fine. Just want the course sorted and for Kieran to sort his sorry ass out or just let me go x
05/01/2015, 20:12 - Big Ran: Yeah fair enough.  It's a head fuck just not knowing what's going on.  feeling like your waiting for things to start x
05/01/2015, 20:13 - abigailcoe: Exactly.
05/01/2015, 20:13 - abigailcoe: And it'll be a long road if it does start at all x
07/01/2015, 20:12 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
07/01/2015, 20:30 - Big Ran: Haha

09/01/2015, 23:57 - abigailcoe: What was the last Daniel kitson thing you saw called?x
10/01/2015, 08:13 - Big Ran: I think it was just called Christmas story or something.  Or it had no name xx
11/01/2015, 20:23 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
12/01/2015, 20:39 - Big Ran: Haha yeah hard to resist x
13/01/2015, 04:18 - abigailcoe: Hello lovely. I got a long facebook message from Aaron who worked at the yurt who now lives in Japan, it was mainly about how he's thinking about how he should break up with his wife. Just messaging you that because typing it makes it like I'm talking about it so lessens the load. I've been thinking about it a lot and worrying about him. I'm all good though, hope you are too. Xx
13/01/2015, 07:55 - Big Ran: Oh that doesn't sound good.  I hope he's ok. God plan writing it all down xx
13/01/2015, 07:56 - Big Ran: I'm all good really apart from mega super itchy.  Haven't been drinking,  lots of sleeping and healthy food.  Pretty stressed about course,  got to write ago about hormones and eyes and i don't really understand the words let alone explaining it x
13/01/2015, 07:56 - Big Ran: Check this out though.  Such a good idea https://twitter.com/edent/status/554772317738659840?s=04 xx
14/01/2015, 22:14 - abigailcoe: I went Yosemite because bugs. The volume now automatically doesn't make the noise. Wow. X
14/01/2015, 22:16 - abigailcoe: Oh, and that Twitter thing is great x
15/01/2015, 07:16 - Big Ran: Ow cool that's good.  Did you have to start from scratch and wipe everything? X
15/01/2015, 07:17 - Big Ran: And how is it in other aspects? X
15/01/2015, 14:42 - abigailcoe: Oh no, it just updated all lovely. I like it so far, looks nice, most of the changes as far as I have seen are more about ios integration so boring. But the new font is nice and I like the flat icons x
15/01/2015, 21:35 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
15/01/2015, 21:36 - Big Ran: Hahaha fucking a!xx
16/01/2015, 08:02 - Big Ran: The company that runs a few old man pubs around sound n bristol are called Wetherforks Ltd x
16/01/2015, 08:35 - abigailcoe: Haha, amazing x
17/01/2015, 10:34 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
17/01/2015, 10:35 - Big Ran: Nephew mark 2 x
17/01/2015, 10:36 - abigailcoe: I didn't even know it was on it's way!!x
17/01/2015, 10:37 - abigailcoe: Big congratulations to everyone xxx
17/01/2015, 10:37 - abigailcoe: Is Olivia still on the same number?x
17/01/2015, 10:38 - Big Ran: Yeah she is,  but might be switching between that and her India number x
17/01/2015, 10:38 - Big Ran: Are you trying to phone her? X
17/01/2015, 10:39 - Big Ran: Indolivia.vcf (file attached)
17/01/2015, 10:48 - abigailcoe: Found her! We're at the theatre for the Daniel kitson thing x
18/01/2015, 16:53 - Big Ran: I didn't know that if you hold shift whilst pressing volume up and down buttons it plays the sound or doesn't depending on whether you have it set on or off.  Also the new yosemite sound is even worse xx
18/01/2015, 17:03 - abigailcoe: There's a new volume sound? I have no idea why I'm not getting any sound at all. What's the new gremlin called? X
18/01/2015, 21:41 - abigailcoe: Yeah, you're right, the sound is waaaayy worse x
18/01/2015, 21:41 - abigailcoe: For 'gremlin' read 'nephew' x
19/01/2015, 08:26 - Big Ran: No name yet for gremlin,  just baby x
19/01/2015, 11:50 - Big Ran: Baby is called Leon x
20/01/2015, 11:48 - abigailcoe: Are you working Thursday day?x
20/01/2015, 11:57 - Big Ran: Yeah til about 3. Do you know what days you are working next week? X
20/01/2015, 11:58 - abigailcoe: I think I have Monday and Tuesday off next week x
20/01/2015, 12:00 - Big Ran: Oh poo.  I think I'm coming Tuesday or Wednesday x
20/01/2015, 12:01 - abigailcoe: I'll double check my rota tomorrow. How long you up for?x
20/01/2015, 12:01 - Big Ran: Not sure.  I want to see you and baby and Helen and tree x
20/01/2015, 12:02 - abigailcoe: I'm sure we'll be able to work something out, mornings are usually do able x
20/01/2015, 12:02 - abigailcoe: Obviously I don't know what the other kitson stuff was like, but I really enjoyed tree x
20/01/2015, 12:03 - Big Ran: Oh good,  yeah Olivia really liked it too.x
20/01/2015, 12:03 - Big Ran: Oh yeah I forgot about mornings x
20/01/2015, 12:04 - Big Ran: What are you doing this Thursday? X
20/01/2015, 12:04 - abigailcoe: Coming down for another prescription, haha
20/01/2015, 12:04 - abigailcoe: Can't decide if I should drive or train. I'm very tired x
20/01/2015, 12:06 - Big Ran: Train! Love the train x
20/01/2015, 12:06 - Big Ran: Do you want me to just send it again?
20/01/2015, 12:07 - abigailcoe: I don't want to put you out x
20/01/2015, 12:07 - Big Ran: I honestly don't mind,  I know I was a bit slack with last one but I Definitely finish work in time this Thursday x
20/01/2015, 12:08 - Big Ran: And trains are expensive x
20/01/2015, 12:08 - abigailcoe: 😭 it would help me so much, I'm having a day off sick because I've finally got exhausted x
20/01/2015, 12:09 - abigailcoe: You are the greatest xx
20/01/2015, 12:09 - Big Ran: Ow no.  I'm not surpr I sed.  Poor you x
20/01/2015, 12:09 - abigailcoe: Haha, I'll be ok. I'm going to make ratatouille x
20/01/2015, 12:10 - Big Ran: I will be super organised and pre stamp and address an envelope x
20/01/2015, 12:10 - Big Ran: Although you'll have to send me your address x
20/01/2015, 12:10 - abigailcoe: Found an apparently incredible tomato sauce recipe which is just tomatoes, a missive lump of butter and an onion cut in half x
20/01/2015, 12:11 - Big Ran: And I'll have to find an envelope x
20/01/2015, 12:11 - abigailcoe: Haha, amazing x
20/01/2015, 12:11 - Big Ran: I've made that better,  it's fucking lush x
20/01/2015, 12:11 - abigailcoe: Oh wicked!x
20/01/2015, 12:11 - Big Ran: I didn't know other people would write it down though,  i thought it was a bit naughty x
20/01/2015, 12:12 - abigailcoe: Smitten kitchen writes them all down x
20/01/2015, 12:12 - abigailcoe: Are you alright? X
20/01/2015, 12:12 - abigailcoe: 52 Redmans Road, Stepney Green, E1 3AQ
20/01/2015, 12:14 - Big Ran: Right now I am mega blocked up and have a massive headache and also got my first batch of sadness and anxiety since new year yesterday but I think it'll be alright.  I did a mediation course at the weekend and now I just have to do that twice a day for the rest of my life and everything will be fine.  If you trust David lynch xx
20/01/2015, 12:17 - abigailcoe: Haha, awww, he's weird. But he seems happy which is what we're going for. That's brilliant doing a course, I'm glad. Twice a day for the rest of your life is totally doable xx
20/01/2015, 12:21 - Big Ran: Also I've been using the quickmist spray stuff.  It's totally addictive (obviously) but I love it.  Going to work on making my own as I have loads of vape juice and i can't use it anymore x
20/01/2015, 12:29 - abigailcoe: What's that?x
20/01/2015, 12:29 - abigailcoe: You not vaping any more?x
20/01/2015, 12:30 - Big Ran: No it makes me too wheezy.  I'm wheezy anyway but lots more of I vape x
20/01/2015, 12:58 - abigailcoe: I never asked you about that new battery you tried, how was it? X
20/01/2015, 12:58 - abigailcoe: I think I would like to try the mist x
20/01/2015, 12:58 - Big Ran: Oh it's good,  I like it x
20/01/2015, 12:59 - Big Ran: Oh the mist.  Ah,  it's half price at the at least Lloyds pharmacies,  even if it doesn't say on the shelf.  It is x
20/01/2015, 12:59 - Big Ran: The staff sometimes don't even know it exists x
20/01/2015, 13:00 - abigailcoe: Huh?x
20/01/2015, 13:00 - Big Ran: It is better than smoking at giving you that ahh feeling x
20/01/2015, 13:00 - abigailcoe: Wow, really?x
20/01/2015, 13:00 - Big Ran: Well maybe not better but nearly x
20/01/2015, 13:00 - abigailcoe: That's crazy x
20/01/2015, 13:00 - abigailcoe: But compared to vaping?x
20/01/2015, 13:01 - Big Ran: Apparently it's second to smoking in efficiency x
20/01/2015, 13:01 - abigailcoe: Amazing. How much is it half price? And do you feel like you're cutting down?x
20/01/2015, 13:02 - Big Ran: It wipes the floor with vaping in my opinion,  except I like the vapor bit x
20/01/2015, 13:02 - abigailcoe: This tomato sauce smells like when I cook beans with butter x
20/01/2015, 13:03 - Big Ran: Half price is 9 pounds something.  But I honestly Wouldn't actually recommend it.  It's a dangerous road to go down as it's so much more efficient then you just get a higher Tollerance to nicotine x
20/01/2015, 13:04 - abigailcoe: Ohhhh, I seee. So many dangerous x
20/01/2015, 13:05 - Big Ran: I've been looking Into vaping and you actually absorb hardly any compared to smoking because it can't absorb in your lungs very well so it's just your mouth.  That's why you use it more,  because you get less nicotine and it is slower release x
20/01/2015, 13:06 - abigailcoe: So confusing. So maybe I'm not as crazy hooked as I thought I was? Actually, that sort of makes sense, because when I lost mine I was fine on like 4 cigarettes, but it was just gross. I have no idea what to do x
20/01/2015, 13:09 - Big Ran: Yeah I know I feel tricked,  but it's actually very clever and a much better way to get people stopping altogether tab I originally thought.  Because although your addicted to using it your not that physically addicted xx
20/01/2015, 13:11 - abigailcoe: This makes me feel positive!x
20/01/2015, 13:11 - Big Ran: Oh yeah so can we hang out next Thursday morning? I'm going to go to Helens Wednesday night the tree play on Thursday afternoon xx
20/01/2015, 13:13 - abigailcoe: Almost definitely! I usually do one open shift a week, which starts at ten, but it probably won't be then. What time is the play? Are you going by yourself? I'll let you know when I check the rota tomorrow but I'm sure it'll be fine. I'm so glad you get to see it xx
20/01/2015, 13:15 - Big Ran: Yeah it's only not sold out Thursday afternoon so I'm going then.  It's at two x
20/01/2015, 13:15 - Big Ran: Yeah by myself.  I can't think of anyone else you wouldn't be working x
20/01/2015, 13:16 - abigailcoe: I would have loved to have gone by myself, it'll be great x
20/01/2015, 15:28 - Big Ran: Have you listened to last weeks TAL or radiolab or the new invisibilia? X
20/01/2015, 15:32 - abigailcoe: Both tal and radio lab x
20/01/2015, 15:34 - abigailcoe: Really like the Batman, not so much the girl boy one. Maybe just subject matter though. Haven't really got my head around invisibilia as a series yet. And hate the name. What did you think? X
20/01/2015, 15:41 - Big Ran: I like the content,  not keen on the name.  It feels kind of like serial meets old radiolab.  Serial probably just because of the female presenters and small bits of unprofessionalism but I like it,  then again I am just a podcast sponge x
20/01/2015, 15:55 - abigailcoe: I agree. Haha, yes you are, but there are plenty worse sponges to be. I've gotten well in to WTF. Maron is good. X
20/01/2015, 18:35 - Big Ran: Yeah he is really good.  I sometimes have to skip the rant at the beginning though as they ago get pretty samey x
21/01/2015, 21:58 - abigailcoe: Elvis Costello came in for dinner! That excited me. X
23/01/2015, 17:00 - abigailcoe: Did you get the prescription?x
23/01/2015, 17:00 - Big Ran: Shhhiiit
23/01/2015, 17:01 - Big Ran: I totally forgot
23/01/2015, 17:01 - Big Ran: Are they still open?
23/01/2015, 17:01 - abigailcoe: Haha, I should have reminded you, sorry xx
23/01/2015, 17:01 - abigailcoe: I think so...
23/01/2015, 17:01 - abigailcoe: I'll check x
23/01/2015, 17:01 - Big Ran: Know x
23/01/2015, 17:01 - Big Ran: K even x
23/01/2015, 17:02 - abigailcoe: Till half six x
23/01/2015, 17:02 - Big Ran: Cool I'll go now xx
23/01/2015, 17:02 - abigailcoe: Your the best, thank you x
23/01/2015, 17:21 - Big Ran: Have you run out already? Xx
23/01/2015, 17:22 - abigailcoe: Enough to last till Monday x
25/01/2015, 17:33 - abigailcoe: Is it in the post babs? X
25/01/2015, 18:31 - Big Ran: Yep.It should arrive tomorrow xx
26/01/2015, 15:27 - Big Ran: Did it arrive? X
26/01/2015, 15:29 - abigailcoe: Yep, thanks so much xx
26/01/2015, 19:26 - Big Ran: That's quite alright,  glad you got them in time.  I'm looking forward to seeing you xx
26/01/2015, 20:51 - abigailcoe: Oh God yeah! I almost forgot you're coming here. So good, can't wait x
28/01/2015, 15:50 - Big Ran: Hello love,  how's it going? X
28/01/2015, 16:02 - abigailcoe: Not bad thanks sweet, how are you? X
28/01/2015, 16:06 - Big Ran: Yeah I'm alright,  trying to study in British library,  not gong that well.  You still up for a morning visit? C
28/01/2015, 16:06 - Big Ran: X
28/01/2015, 20:35 - abigailcoe: Yes, definitely. But maybe not super early, I'm on a close tonight, it shouldn't be too late, but you know. Oh, and I'm not working till four tomorrow so that's good. I've always wanted to go to the British library but never have! I guess I can now I live here x
28/01/2015, 20:37 - Big Ran: Amazing,  well Helen is working at 9 so I'm going to get up with her and go out but I can just do some work til you wake up.  Got to leave at about 1 to go to Daniel kitson xx
29/01/2015, 01:07 - Big Ran: What time do you think you'll be up?  I might get up a bit later but I don't want to miss out on any Abi time xx
29/01/2015, 01:40 - abigailcoe: I've no idea, I'm out in Soho with some of the bar boys. Just ring me when you wake up and that'll sort it x
29/01/2015, 01:41 - Big Ran: Haha ok cool xx
29/01/2015, 17:50 - Big Ran: I didn't get it.  But I don't think he said the name on the phone at the end x
29/01/2015, 21:17 - abigailcoe: Ah nuts. What did you think of it anyway?x
29/01/2015, 21:18 - Big Ran: Yeah really liked it.  Was very cleverly done and very funny x
29/01/2015, 21:18 - abigailcoe: I loved the grape bit. I loved all of it really x
07/02/2015, 10:40 - abigailcoe: Hey love. Would you help me with a small bit of whatsapp research please? X
07/02/2015, 11:27 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
07/02/2015, 13:00 - Big Ran: Whatsapp research?  And did you bring your aeropress? X
07/02/2015, 13:30 - abigailcoe: No I didn't bring it, I didn't realise this was here, boo. I might go pick it up next week x
07/02/2015, 13:32 - abigailcoe: Yeah, I wanna see what happens if I delete you number from my phone, and then if I delete our chat, like whether you see it or not. Once someone's chat lost Their name and picture for me, even though I think I had their number stored, I'm not sure if I they blocked me or what. Thinking about deleting Kieran x
07/02/2015, 13:35 - Big Ran: Ah right.  Yeah you can't do anything about my chat,  if it's in my phone.  I don't know about the name and picture though x

22/07/2015, 00:36 - abigailcoe: Hmm, what do you want to know? X
22/07/2015, 00:36 - Big Ran: I don't know anything I don't think , or I can;t remember x
22/07/2015, 00:37 - abigailcoe: Well....uh....I've been describing him as a little punk, because he was in a punk band, and he was famous, but he hated being famous. X
22/07/2015, 00:38 - abigailcoe: But then I was telling Aaron about him and he said he's definitely not a punk, so Aaron now calls him nemo, for not emo, which makes me laugh x
22/07/2015, 00:38 - abigailcoe: He's, you know, clever, and seems like an actual nice person which is nice x
22/07/2015, 00:39 - abigailcoe: We chatted lots about lots of things, and we drank lots of booze, and it was sweet and good x
22/07/2015, 00:39 - Big Ran: aww that sounds great, a nice person! x
22/07/2015, 00:40 - abigailcoe: But I'm scared that he's one of those people who gets way too into girls and then would be really really sad when it ended and cry xx
22/07/2015, 00:40 - abigailcoe: But I'm trying to forget that and....You know...see how it goes...Don't know what that's like. X
22/07/2015, 00:40 - Big Ran: yeah maybe but fuck it, tables have to turn sometimes x
22/07/2015, 00:40 - abigailcoe: Hahaha, true x
22/07/2015, 00:41 - abigailcoe: Anyways, he writes songs for a living, and works in a guitar shop for fun x
22/07/2015, 00:41 - Big Ran: yeah that is the best way, but not easy, seeing how it goes. pah, they make it sound like there is a switch to turn that shit off x
22/07/2015, 00:41 - abigailcoe: And he used to live in Bristol x
22/07/2015, 00:41 - abigailcoe: And he's got a kid...x

22/07/2015, 00:43 - Big Ran: hehe x
22/07/2015, 00:43 - abigailcoe: I don't think it lives in London though, so you know, easier for me x
22/07/2015, 00:44 - abigailcoe: How are you though? Are you good? X
22/07/2015, 00:44 - Big Ran: yeaha true, that's a bonus . nothing you have to think about for a while x
22/07/2015, 00:44 - abigailcoe: Oh, and he's brown, obviously, his parents are mauritian x
22/07/2015, 00:45 - Big Ran: yeah I don't know really, I have been having loads of fun but have just been getting absolutely wasted mostly. Has been great but just not that healthy x
22/07/2015, 00:45 - abigailcoe: As long as you're happy x
22/07/2015, 00:45 - Big Ran: I had a couple of sad days but mostly good really x
22/07/2015, 00:45 - abigailcoe: That's a good hit rate x
22/07/2015, 00:45 - abigailcoe: I'm impressed x
22/07/2015, 00:46 - Big Ran: I found Ely's diamond ring in my tent when I got to the festival and it didn't really bother me, I even went round and posted it through her door, I think she was in as the windows were open but I was alright x
22/07/2015, 00:46 - abigailcoe: It's weird, having had that Skype conversation the other day really makes me feel the limitations of text right now x
22/07/2015, 00:46 - Big Ran: just glad she has it back, it was special to her and she thought she'd lost it x
22/07/2015, 00:47 - abigailcoe: That's incredible Aran, I'd have been a complete wreck, you seem to be dealing with this so well x
22/07/2015, 00:47 - Big Ran: yeah I know, it's proper weird, although i do have the advantage that I'm on my computer, I'm guessing your not x
22/07/2015, 00:48 - abigailcoe: Yeah I am, bit the house is quiet x
22/07/2015, 00:48 - abigailcoe: Now for the most important question.

22/07/2015, 00:48 - Big Ran: I know I am doing really well but I still want her back sooo much x
22/07/2015, 00:49 - abigailcoe: Of course. Xx
22/07/2015, 00:49 - abigailcoe: I'm glad you're doing ok though, it could have been much worse x
22/07/2015, 00:49 - Big Ran: haha I have been mostly falling asleep to Humans, game of thrones and various films I can't get to the end of. I have been so shit at actually getting to the end of anything, can't stay awake or really concentrate x
22/07/2015, 00:49 - abigailcoe: Humans is GOOD. X
22/07/2015, 00:50 - abigailcoe: The last episode was 😮
22/07/2015, 00:50 - Big Ran: oh yeah totally, and I have been chatting to loads of people through tinder which is quite fun. might even go on some more dates when I can drink again x
22/07/2015, 00:50 - abigailcoe: Oh yeah! You didn't watch thrones yet! X
22/07/2015, 00:51 - abigailcoe: Tinder is such a good thing. People don't give it enough credit. X
22/07/2015, 00:51 - abigailcoe: Hels at work has run out of people. In fucking London. X
22/07/2015, 00:51 - Big Ran: I have only just managed to get through 3 so far of Humans and about the same in GOT, though I have probably watched each three about 3 times each ish x
22/07/2015, 00:52 - Big Ran: haha no fucking way, I have run out so many times but still haven't found Olivia x
22/07/2015, 00:52 - abigailcoe: Jesus. Maybe it'll be easier with not drinking x
22/07/2015, 00:52 - Big Ran: found emily and Ely but not olivia. tinder is a nob x
22/07/2015, 00:52 - abigailcoe: Really?! That's so weird. X
22/07/2015, 00:52 - Big Ran: yeah it's really weird, she hasn't found me either x
22/07/2015, 00:52 - abigailcoe: Maybe Olivia swiped you left and is keeping it secret. X
22/07/2015, 00:53 - Big Ran: It is vaguely possible that if your both on the same IP address you don't show up but that all seems a bit too clever x
22/07/2015, 00:53 - Big Ran: have you watched don't hug me I'm scared?
22/07/2015, 00:53 - abigailcoe: Hmm. Maybe.x

22/07/2015, 00:55 - abigailcoe: Legit.
22/07/2015, 00:55 - abigailcoe: (taking the piss out of myself/London) x

22/07/2015, 00:57 - abigailcoe: Haha, yes I did notice that. I was by turns amazed and disgusted by your choice of spelling x
22/07/2015, 00:57 - Big Ran: I don't think I have laughed that much in such a long time, also met a guy who was trying to spread the word about a new acronym FASS x
22/07/2015, 00:58 - Big Ran: hehe yeah I am shit at the game to be fair x

22/07/2015, 00:59 - abigailcoe: Maybe context makes it different. X
22/07/2015, 01:00 - Big Ran: oh my god Abi and you just had a dig at me for not watching game of thrones yet x
22/07/2015, 01:00 - Big Ran: did you like the little creatures in the trees? x

22/07/2015, 01:03 - abigailcoe: I'm in love with tea, and you, and myself. Don't say love lightly like that. Most people aren't in love with rivers. X
22/07/2015, 01:03 - Big Ran: I was excited about watching game of thrones but now I've tried and slept a lot I feel less excited x
22/07/2015, 01:03 - abigailcoe: Then leave it longer. X
22/07/2015, 01:03 - abigailcoe: I think I'm going to watch elementary again. X
22/07/2015, 01:03 - Big Ran: I dunno, depends on which river and how many hallucinogens you've had x
22/07/2015, 01:03 - abigailcoe: I'm excited about cooking peppers tomorrow x
22/07/2015, 01:04 - Big Ran: aww I wish I hadn't rewatched it all already, I would love watch it all again, I really like it x
22/07/2015, 01:04 - abigailcoe: Yeah, like I said, most people haven't done all the hallucinogens, and so aren't in love with rivers x
22/07/2015, 01:04 - Big Ran: true x
22/07/2015, 01:05 - abigailcoe: I wish I hadn't told you about the peppers. I'm hungry now.x
22/07/2015, 01:05 - abigailcoe: Anyways, I'm going to sleep. Miss you xx

08/08/2015, 19:36 - Big Ran: just pictures then x
08/08/2015, 19:36 - abigailcoe: That's good. Swag is always good.x
08/08/2015, 19:36 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
08/08/2015, 19:36 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
08/08/2015, 19:37 - Big Ran: aww is that Lotta?
08/08/2015, 19:37 - abigailcoe: Holly x
08/08/2015, 19:38 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
08/08/2015, 19:38 - Big Ran: haha amazing x
08/08/2015, 19:38 - Big Ran: that's what I think is gonna happen to me tonight x
08/08/2015, 19:38 - abigailcoe: Even better is that I took that picture of her at 7pm x
08/08/2015, 19:38 - Big Ran: wow what is it, roast chicken? x
08/08/2015, 19:39 - abigailcoe: Confit duck x
08/08/2015, 19:39 - Big Ran: oooo fancy x
08/08/2015, 19:39 - abigailcoe: You know me x
08/08/2015, 19:40 - abigailcoe: What's with this tinder bird then?x
08/08/2015, 19:42 - Big Ran: oh yeah so basically when we first matched she was a sausage roll. Then she deleted it and now she is a molass. We have one mutual friend which is Omar but i have no idea how well they know each other x
08/08/2015, 19:42 - abigailcoe: She is a molass?x
08/08/2015, 19:43 - Big Ran: Have I not told you about molasses? x
08/08/2015, 19:43 - abigailcoe: Uh, no x
08/08/2015, 19:44 - Big Ran: ok so basically it just comes from imagining from reading ingredients that molasses was actually a kind of small cute aminal, then from there it changed to being people who you meet and want to take home with you, possibly in your apron pocket x
08/08/2015, 19:45 - abigailcoe: And she's got a picture of molasses?x
08/08/2015, 19:45 - Big Ran: no, I just think she is one x
08/08/2015, 19:46 - abigailcoe: You're hella confusing today x
08/08/2015, 19:46 - Big Ran: I might have not had much sleep and have been drinking x
08/08/2015, 19:46 - abigailcoe: What about the sausage roll though?x
08/08/2015, 19:48 - Big Ran: ohhh ok so she was just a picture of a sausage roll, I liked it obviously (at the time I couldn't tell whether it was sweet or savoury but it looked tasty either way) we matched, then she diapearred, then came back as a person x
08/08/2015, 19:48 - abigailcoe: They're always savoury x
08/08/2015, 19:48 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
08/08/2015, 19:48 - abigailcoe: Super cute x
08/08/2015, 19:49 - Big Ran: bit storky but this is what a molass looks like x
08/08/2015, 19:49 - abigailcoe: Stalky?x
08/08/2015, 19:49 - Big Ran: yeah and with the short hair she could quite possibly be a bit gay so obviously right up my street x
08/08/2015, 19:49 - abigailcoe: Haha, was thinking the same x
08/08/2015, 19:49 - Big Ran: oh just screenshotting from someones facebook who you've never met x
08/08/2015, 19:50 - abigailcoe: Standard. You're talking to the master x
08/08/2015, 19:50 - Big Ran: yeah I know ;} x
08/08/2015, 19:59 - Big Ran: I hope you manage to feel better lovely, I gotta go. I mean obviously I am still on my phone but just not on the computer and out xx
08/08/2015, 20:07 - abigailcoe: I just always feel the urge to send ever so slightly provocative messages when I get ignored like I'm being ignored at the moment.x
08/08/2015, 20:08 - abigailcoe: Especially when the last time I saw that boy we had a conversation about ghosting relationships and he said he would never ever do that.x
08/08/2015, 20:08 - abigailcoe: Ugh.x
09/08/2015, 19:41 - abigailcoe: I want someone to make an app for torrents that will tell you at the end just how long it actually took to download, and maybe even how many times the predicted tune remaining was correct. X
09/08/2015, 19:41 - abigailcoe: Oh, and I had a realisation about myself. I'll copy paste it, yo.x
09/08/2015, 19:41 - abigailcoe: I think maybe I'm realising that I'm not grown up enough mentally to do relationships in the modern world. The blue ticks and the last active kill me. And because I'm so wary of dating people who aren't all that bothered, because I've fallen afoul of it before, that I jump the gun and go off and end it to avoid the stress and anxiety it gives me. I sound crazy. X
09/08/2015, 19:42 - Big Ran: yeah that would be really good for the numbers game x
09/08/2015, 19:42 - abigailcoe: How are you feeling today?x
09/08/2015, 19:43 - Big Ran: yeah I know ecactly what you mean. I am very similar as you know and it ruins everything. I think there is ways of coping with the relationship anxiety thing but ideally would be possible to relieve it completely  somehow, maybe with the whole love yourself cliche shit you know x
09/08/2015, 19:44 - abigailcoe: Or get a 3210 x
09/08/2015, 19:46 - Big Ran: I'm hungover and drunk again. I had a really fun night and day with Lou (I met her through tinder before me and ely and she knows friends from brighton) and it was just as I had imagined and hoped in that we were like we had been friends for years. there was some cuddling and kisses and we spend all day together in the park. was really nice xx
09/08/2015, 19:46 - Big Ran: I have to go to the pub now as we have pizza waiting x
09/08/2015, 19:46 - abigailcoe: O
09/08/2015, 19:46 - abigailcoe: M
09/08/2015, 19:46 - abigailcoe: G
09/08/2015, 19:46 - abigailcoe: Have fun! X
10/08/2015, 16:20 - abigailcoe: I'm dying over Doug Stanhope's dog names. Ichabod, Henry Phillips, Trousers and Meat Wig. He's so messed up. X
10/08/2015, 16:29 - Big Ran: haha yeah he has a very unusual mind. did you listen to the podcast with his niece?
10/08/2015, 16:30 - abigailcoe: I'm not sure, I think only a bit of it x
10/08/2015, 16:32 - Big Ran: it was a good one, I just love his story about going to the local airport at 6 am and they just get their drinks ready without having to order x
10/08/2015, 16:32 - Big Ran: I don't know why but alcoholism can be really funny x
10/08/2015, 16:33 - Big Ran: How are you doing, feeling better? x
10/08/2015, 16:35 - abigailcoe: Yeah, it's always tainted with sadness, but he does it very well. It's crazy how appalling the way he talks about his life is x
10/08/2015, 16:37 - abigailcoe: Yeah, I'm alright. Chatted to lilas for ages yesterday and laughed a lot. Worked some stuff out. Lots of other people are feeling the same at the moment. Edo says he does exactly the same thing which surprised me, and Aaron is all vulnerable and insecure at the mo which is really unlike him. I feel pretty good, considering x
10/08/2015, 16:38 - Big Ran: haha nothing quite like others misery eh x
10/08/2015, 16:38 - abigailcoe: Just knowing you aren't alone, and when it's from people you think have it sorted it's amazing. X
10/08/2015, 16:40 - Big Ran: yeah that's so true, it works for me, I remember that from listening to desert island disks, can't remember the woman's name but she is an actress and was really useful to me at the time to hear her struggles as she seemed so sorted x
10/08/2015, 16:42 - abigailcoe: Tell me if you remember. How are you?x
10/08/2015, 16:42 - Big Ran: Emma Thompson i think x
10/08/2015, 16:43 - abigailcoe: Oh, I heard that. All I remember was her husband built a memorial walk so her mum could go round their garden x
10/08/2015, 16:44 - Big Ran: I'm pretty tired, keep waking up at 5, was pretty soggy at work but yeah I'm really good. Molass girl just asked me for an impromptu drink which is exciting but she hasn't replied since I said yes so starting to get nervous x
10/08/2015, 16:44 - abigailcoe: But what about Lou?x
10/08/2015, 16:45 - Big Ran: things are much easier when there is no waiting, cos you don't have time to think x
10/08/2015, 16:45 - Big Ran: ahh me and Lou I don't think will be a thing, she is moving to Brighton  soon too x
10/08/2015, 16:46 - Big Ran: I think I put her off a bit, being too honest, she is gonna be a friend for life though I feel. Or we'll end up getting married one day. either way no rush x
10/08/2015, 16:46 - Big Ran: haha x
11/08/2015, 08:11 - Big Ran: http://reductress.com/post/ways-to-lose-all-perspective-when-hes-five-minutes-late/ x
12/08/2015, 13:04 - Big Ran: How are you today lovely? Xx
12/08/2015, 13:31 - abigailcoe: Yeah, meh. I'm alright. You? Xx
12/08/2015, 13:31 - Big Ran: Yeah I'm good.  sleepy but Good x
12/08/2015, 13:32 - Big Ran: You working and why meh?x
12/08/2015, 13:33 - abigailcoe: Day off, meh just because I'm sitting in my dressing gown at one thirty and I don't know what I'm doing with my life x
12/08/2015, 13:33 - abigailcoe: Why sleepy?x
12/08/2015, 13:33 - Big Ran: Ahh yes i know that we'll except I'm not organised enough to own a dressing gown.  X
12/08/2015, 13:34 - abigailcoe: I usually just wait till people buy them for me x
12/08/2015, 13:34 - Big Ran: Oh I just keep waking up stupidly early x
12/08/2015, 13:34 - abigailcoe: Weird!x
12/08/2015, 13:34 - Big Ran: Ahhh that's clever x
12/08/2015, 13:34 - abigailcoe: It's happened twice!x
12/08/2015, 13:34 - abigailcoe: What you doing today?x
12/08/2015, 13:35 - Big Ran: I'm staying in waiting for the autglass people from 2:30 x
12/08/2015, 13:35 - abigailcoe: Oh no! What happened?x
12/08/2015, 13:37 - Big Ran: Oh the front windscreen cracked, not sure why, there is no damage or bashes or anything x
12/08/2015, 13:38 - Big Ran: so I was wrong about Lou, I thought I'd totally put her off with my over sharing but she wants to go camping instead x
12/08/2015, 13:38 - abigailcoe: Lou the Brighton one?x
12/08/2015, 13:38 - Big Ran: yeah x
12/08/2015, 13:38 - abigailcoe: Remind me what you over shared again?x
12/08/2015, 13:39 - Big Ran: oh just alcoholism and depression you know. I didn't think it's such a big deal but apparently that often puts people off :) x
12/08/2015, 13:39 - abigailcoe: :)
12/08/2015, 13:40 - abigailcoe: You're not an alcoholic x
12/08/2015, 13:40 - Big Ran: well that's debatable x
12/08/2015, 13:40 - abigailcoe: Go talk to Stanhope x
12/08/2015, 13:41 - abigailcoe: "I'm Doug Stanhope, and that's why I drink"x
12/08/2015, 13:41 - Big Ran: Yeah true but I think it's just I'm not mean to anyone x
12/08/2015, 13:41 - Big Ran: hahaha love that x
12/08/2015, 13:41 - abigailcoe: I only just realised how good it was like yesterday x
12/08/2015, 13:41 - abigailcoe: But still, you're not x
12/08/2015, 13:42 - Big Ran: hahaha he is so dark and cheery x
12/08/2015, 13:42 - abigailcoe: It's amazing. Getting obsessed x
12/08/2015, 13:42 - abigailcoe: What about the other tinder ones?x
12/08/2015, 13:42 - Big Ran: there is sooo many to listen to though if you're starting now x
12/08/2015, 13:43 - abigailcoe: Nah, there's only like eighty! That's not enough!
12/08/2015, 13:43 - abigailcoe: It makes me laugh in a different way to anything else x
12/08/2015, 13:43 - Big Ran: there is only the one who works at souk kitchen, she is really nice, I'll just wait and see if she contacts me I suppose, she said she would but we only met for an hour x
12/08/2015, 13:44 - abigailcoe: Molasses?x
12/08/2015, 13:44 - Big Ran: I don't really know about this whole dating thing, everyone else seems to go on dates with lots of different people but I feel proper weird about it x
12/08/2015, 13:44 - Big Ran: yeah her x
12/08/2015, 13:44 - abigailcoe: People say things x
12/08/2015, 13:44 - abigailcoe: What kind of weird?x
12/08/2015, 13:44 - abigailcoe: It is weird tho x
12/08/2015, 13:46 - Big Ran: just like that I don't know if I have space in me for two people, it's confusing and feels deceitful even though it's not really as it's pretty much accepted as long as you wouldn\t lie if you were asked x
12/08/2015, 13:46 - abigailcoe: Oh, you mean dating two people at once? Yeah, I don't like doing that. X
12/08/2015, 13:47 - abigailcoe: I don't care if it's accepted, it feels wrong x
12/08/2015, 13:47 - Big Ran: yeah exactly but it's not anything other than drinks and chatting but still feels wrong. Don't like it x
12/08/2015, 13:48 - abigailcoe: That's kind of one of the things that made me go insane about this Jamie, he was still on tinder and changing his pictures and bio, felt weird with all the shit he'd Said to me x
12/08/2015, 13:48 - Big Ran: and I haven't even done it yet x
12/08/2015, 13:48 - abigailcoe: Don't do it then x
12/08/2015, 13:49 - Big Ran: yeah exactly, I actually only went on tinder after meeting elektra to see if she had been on, which is ridiculous x
12/08/2015, 13:49 - abigailcoe: Elektra? Crazy name. Not a fan. X
12/08/2015, 13:49 - abigailcoe: That's exactly the same with me x
12/08/2015, 13:49 - abigailcoe: Ugh hate it x
12/08/2015, 13:51 - Big Ran: yeah exactly, it sucks, it is so stupid. I think I might delete my thing actually x
12/08/2015, 13:51 - abigailcoe: Yeah, but I know I'll just download it again if I feel lonely x
12/08/2015, 13:52 - Big Ran: such a load of shit in terms of mind consumption and it makes people a bit shitty towards each other cos they can just go back on x
12/08/2015, 13:52 - abigailcoe: But tbh, I kinda feel now like I just wanna sack it off and I can/text see angry boy if I'm lonely until I eventually meet someone irl x
12/08/2015, 13:52 - Big Ran: yeah I know, and it is fun too definitely, but most people would chat for a day and then stop replying x
12/08/2015, 13:53 - Big Ran: yeah I think that's a good idea, meeting real people in normal social things is much for fun even when nothing happens about it x
12/08/2015, 13:53 - abigailcoe: Except I'm chatting to one dude who's leftover from last time. I'll probably go for a drink with him. He seems pretty good, but he doesn't eat pork boo x
12/08/2015, 13:53 - abigailcoe: Tried to claim that beef and chicken sausages were as good as normal ones x
12/08/2015, 13:54 - Big Ran: some of them are pretty good, they are as good in terms of shit for shit x
12/08/2015, 13:55 - abigailcoe: Yeah, but they don't taste like sausage, do they x
12/08/2015, 13:55 - abigailcoe: That's my main beef x
12/08/2015, 13:55 - Big Ran: but they ain't no decent sausage made out of chicken and beef x
12/08/2015, 13:55 - abigailcoe: Exactly x
15/08/2015, 16:52 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
15/08/2015, 22:39 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
20/08/2015, 12:49 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
20/08/2015, 12:55 - Big Ran: I reckon.  Dont imagine there are many Martin blundens x
20/08/2015, 15:11 - abigailcoe: Ask him if you can be bothered, I'm not going to be in but I'll see if I can get him a round of drinks if it is him. But that would involve you warning him to play along like he remembers who I am.
20/08/2015, 15:11 - abigailcoe: X
20/08/2015, 15:12 - Big Ran: Haha your funny.  I'll find out though,  I don't have his number but I'll Facebook him x
20/08/2015, 15:12 - Big Ran: How are you? X
20/08/2015, 15:15 - abigailcoe: I'm alright. Bullshit, but whatever. Xx
20/08/2015, 15:15 - abigailcoe: How are you?x
20/08/2015, 15:17 - Big Ran: Same bullshit? X
20/08/2015, 15:17 - Big Ran: Yeah I'm good,  just about to go out canoeing with Dory in the docks x
20/08/2015, 15:28 - abigailcoe: Different, similar, same, it's all bullshit. X
20/08/2015, 15:28 - abigailcoe: Oh that sounds so good! Have fun xx
24/08/2015, 23:09 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
25/08/2015, 00:14 - abigailcoe: Ugh, I think I just died a bit on the inside. X
25/08/2015, 00:15 - Big Ran: Haha yeah I know right.  Although it also did make me laugh a little x
25/08/2015, 23:31 - abigailcoe: I just watched a profile of the guy who invented aeropress, and it occurred to me how silly it is that I don't really like coffee much at all, but I fucking love my aeropress. X
25/08/2015, 23:40 - Big Ran: Hahaha yeah I did always think that xx
25/08/2015, 23:41 - abigailcoe: Haha, I love you xx
25/08/2015, 23:42 - Big Ran: Love you too xx

03/09/2015, 12:27 - abigailcoe: Have you got any macbooks for sale? Matt needs to buy one for his nephew for sixth form. X
03/09/2015, 15:15 - Big Ran: I do have two.  both 2009 one 15 inch with ssd and hard disk and one 13 inch with dvd drive still in it.  Around three hundred each xx
03/09/2015, 15:19 - abigailcoe: Amazing, I'll let him know. So you removed the DVD drive from the 15 inch to fit the ssd in? X
03/09/2015, 15:22 - abigailcoe: And can I give him your number? X
03/09/2015, 15:23 - Big Ran: Yes of course x

06/09/2015, 19:37 - Big Ran: Real life,  me and Olivia actually just had a day out in Weston x
06/09/2015, 19:37 - Big Ran: How are you? X
06/09/2015, 19:37 - abigailcoe: Oh lush, and good. Much better idea x
06/09/2015, 19:38 - abigailcoe: I'm sad. Just wondered if you were available to talk at me on Skype x
06/09/2015, 19:38 - Big Ran: Haha yeah it's been great.  We went to sandland x
06/09/2015, 19:38 - abigailcoe: Wicked x
06/09/2015, 19:42 - abigailcoe: If you're free later it'd be nice to be talked at x
06/09/2015, 19:43 - Big Ran: I reckon I can manage that.  Just about.  I have a lot of words but a painful tongue x
06/09/2015, 21:16 - Big Ran: I just got home.  do you wanna facetime? X
06/09/2015, 21:17 - abigailcoe: Yes please, is it on my computer? I'll look for it x

06/09/2015, 21:18 - abigailcoe: Haha, you'll have to give me at least five minutes to figure my Apple id out x
06/09/2015, 21:19 - Big Ran: Ok cool.  Your password had to have a capitol letter and numbers in it x

They do ask you how you like your tea but then totally ignore anything you tell them, thinking that you’re bound to enjoy their tea better
They ask you and then violently disagree, pointing out all the reasons why you are wrong and misguided.
They try and make it as you have requested but get it all wrong, either maliciously or through ineptitude.
They tell you to make your own tea, not from compassion but because they can’t stand to make it in the degenerate way you have suggested

28/09/2015, 16:47 - Big Ran: Haha that's great x
30/09/2015, 13:47 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
30/09/2015, 23:08 - abigailcoe: Err, what? X
30/09/2015, 23:09 - abigailcoe: Also, snapchat just told me you replayed my snap. I can't even remember what it was x
30/09/2015, 23:10 - Big Ran: It was pretty freaky. I didn't even realise I had it.  Is you with rainbows out your mouth and freaky eyes x
30/09/2015, 23:10 - abigailcoe: Oh, nyan cat in my mouth! X
30/09/2015, 23:10 - Big Ran: I didn't know you could replay them either.  Mad shit x
30/09/2015, 23:10 - Big Ran: Haha yeah that's the one x
30/09/2015, 23:11 - abigailcoe: What is that Craig David all about? X
30/09/2015, 23:12 - Big Ran: Oh yeah i just decided it was time to start taking more of an interest in what he was up to these days x
30/09/2015, 23:14 - abigailcoe: Don't lie to me ranikus. X
30/09/2015, 23:17 - Big Ran: Nah I'm not really,  I actually am filtwering him on instagram.  Thought it'd be funny.  So far not that funny x
30/09/2015, 23:17 - abigailcoe: You need to up your game x
30/09/2015, 23:18 - Big Ran: Beyonce?x
30/09/2015, 23:19 - Big Ran: Or her sister which I had no idea existed til the other day x
30/09/2015, 23:19 - abigailcoe: Nah, she's not funny. With Taylor Swift you at least get entertaining cat pictures x
30/09/2015, 23:19 - abigailcoe: Solange is good. Not in instagram terms though x
30/09/2015, 23:21 - Big Ran: Yeah she is good.  I had no idea x
30/09/2015, 23:21 - abigailcoe: It's no wonder really, what with you being so racist and all x
30/09/2015, 23:22 - Big Ran: Good point but now I know about her and Craig David,  I'm on the road to recovery x
01/10/2015, 13:49 - abigailcoe: They made a film of A Walk In The Woods?? X
02/10/2015, 16:41 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
02/10/2015, 16:41 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
02/10/2015, 16:41 - Big Ran: Have they already made the film? Xx
02/10/2015, 16:56 - abigailcoe: Yep, it's in cinemas now xx
02/10/2015, 16:56 - abigailcoe: And hehe x
06/10/2015, 09:23 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
06/10/2015, 09:30 - abigailcoe: LOVE it! X
06/10/2015, 09:30 - Big Ran: Haha yeah me too ,  she's funny and practical x
11/10/2015, 17:27 - abigailcoe: When are you leaving for Canada? X
11/10/2015, 17:44 - Big Ran: I'm gonna leave for Peru in January I think now , then canada after that x
11/10/2015, 19:58 - abigailcoe: Ok. Good to know. Probably maybe coming down to Bristol for a few days the end of the week after my birthday, fyi x
11/10/2015, 21:56 - Big Ran: Oh that's exciting.  I'm around the end of that week at least till Saturday afternoon xx
11/10/2015, 21:59 - abigailcoe: Brilliant, probably coming down on the 29th. Let's book some pissing around time. Would be ok to stay at yours for a night or two? Xx
11/10/2015, 22:01 - Big Ran: Oh right so the week after?  I'm around that week too. I'm going to cat and George's wedding on the 1st and maybe something on Saturday night but no plans other than that I don't think.  Of course you can,  you're always welcome xx
11/10/2015, 22:02 - abigailcoe: Haha yeah, the week after. And thanks so much xx
11/10/2015, 22:02 - abigailcoe: Also, I just realised, I have literally never waited until date three before giving it up. Not even once. Hahahaha, basically x
11/10/2015, 22:03 - abigailcoe: (saying that, I was about to, but I don't know if I'll get past date three with this guy, it might be his last, and with none of the good stuff) x
11/10/2015, 22:04 - Big Ran: hahaha are you on a date right now? x
11/10/2015, 22:04 - abigailcoe: Haha no. Went on a second date last week, and he just annoyed me hugely via whatsapp x
11/10/2015, 22:05 - Big Ran: ohhh I see. Yeah fuck him off if he's being a dick. The 'good stuff' won't make it any better x
11/10/2015, 22:06 - abigailcoe: Yeah I know. It's well weird though, after date one I was like no way, he's way to weird, I shouldn't have kissed him, then after date two I was all oh my God I really fancy him and he's super sweet but he's so fucking odd x
11/10/2015, 22:07 - abigailcoe: I thought it might be a treat and I'd carry on finding him hotter and less weird as it went on x
11/10/2015, 22:07 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
11/10/2015, 22:08 - abigailcoe: He said "haha, I'll be the judge of that" 😐
11/10/2015, 22:10 - Big Ran: hmmm yeah I don't have time for that shit. I don't get peoples obsession with people 'knowing' what they want. When will people just accept that people change their fucking minds all the time and people who are honest and say maybe they don't know are just aware of that x
11/10/2015, 22:10 - abigailcoe: That's exactly what I needed to hear xx
11/10/2015, 22:12 - Big Ran: I discovered for sure that opera girl is a massive nob end this weekend, she phoned me up to brag about getting more free shit from shops and stuff and moan about her friend who has manic depression and a three legged rabbit, just saying how she has no empathy basically . It's good though as I could definitely still hang out but I'm sure I wouldn't want anything more x
11/10/2015, 22:12 - abigailcoe: That is good. Why was she getting free stuff? Was she being a dick? X
11/10/2015, 22:13 - Big Ran: And I've seen Lou a few more times and we've been speaking on facetime a lot this week and she is fucking great, which is also exactly what I didn't but at least in the best kind of way x
11/10/2015, 22:13 - abigailcoe: She's the London one...right?x
11/10/2015, 22:13 - Big Ran: aahhh she just goes around being really chatty and flirty and people (mostly men) give her shit x
11/10/2015, 22:14 - abigailcoe: Ugh. Yuck. Ugh. Gross. Hate her.x
11/10/2015, 22:14 - Big Ran: yeah she's moved to brighton now but yeah x
11/10/2015, 22:14 - Big Ran: I'm going to visit her and see daniel kitson on the 26th x
11/10/2015, 22:15 - abigailcoe: Fuuuuck I just remembered you used to live in Brighton. Feels like another person x
11/10/2015, 22:15 - abigailcoe: Do you see everything he does?x
11/10/2015, 22:16 - abigailcoe: Can we try Skype?x
11/10/2015, 22:16 - Big Ran: Yeah I know, I'm really excited, haven't been there for years, I miss it. Lou has been sending me pictures and I forgot how much I love it. It's insanely expensive now though, like london rents but without the wages x
11/10/2015, 22:16 - Big Ran: can facetime x
11/10/2015, 22:16 - abigailcoe: You're anti Skype now aren't you x
11/10/2015, 22:17 - Big Ran: ahh it's just a whole nother thing to login to x
11/10/2015, 22:17 - abigailcoe: Ok fine, face time. See you there.
11/10/2015, 22:27 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
12/10/2015, 14:40 - abigailcoe: Can you do me a favour and ask Olivia what garage she used when she lived up here? Needs to get my MOT, innit xx
12/10/2015, 20:44 - Big Ran: Hi abi.  Olivia isn't much help as she never got hers done there as she only bought it just before coming to Bristol apart from one bad experience with her previous car with a local garage but that sounds like a one off.  When's your MOT due?x
12/10/2015, 20:51 - abigailcoe: Hi aran. Weird text greeting you did there. I think soon but I can't remember because I'm a waste of space which will probably put 'Money' off wanting to continue dating me. And let's be honest, that's more a win for me that it is for him.x
12/10/2015, 20:52 - Big Ran: Hahaha oh my God I'm turning into my dad in the land of texts x
12/10/2015, 20:53 - Big Ran: I'd check see when it is and get nick to do it when you're in bristol of you can.  He's cheap.  Olivias only cost 85 this year including the text x
12/10/2015, 20:54 - Big Ran: Yeah fuck money,  or don't more importantly x
12/10/2015, 20:55 - abigailcoe: Ooh, oooohhh, interesting! That could work! You're a fucking gold mine x
12/10/2015, 20:56 - abigailcoe: He sent me the world's cheesiest chat up line earlier. Vomit face. X
12/10/2015, 20:56 - Big Ran: Like vomit salad? X
12/10/2015, 20:56 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
12/10/2015, 20:57 - abigailcoe: No, because that shit looks tasty.x
12/10/2015, 22:23 - abigailcoe: Woo hoo! I can't find this year's certificate, but last year's was on Oct 29th, which is about perfect! I can push it by a day, right?? Also: was it you who told me you need a horn to pass it?x
12/10/2015, 22:25 - Big Ran: Oh perfect,  yeah you can do it anytime up to 2 months early i think and late is just a grey area but if it's booked in bristol you're allowed to drive it here.  Yes you need a horn for sure x
12/10/2015, 22:25 - Big Ran: Nick Mechanic.vcf (file attached)
12/10/2015, 22:26 - abigailcoe: Oh, amaze x
12/10/2015, 22:26 - Big Ran: He's fucking weird but nice enough.  Very odd phone Manor too but don't be put off by his lack of conversation or interest.  He'll sort you out I'm sure x
12/10/2015, 22:27 - abigailcoe: Saaaafe! You're my hero ❤
12/10/2015, 22:27 - abigailcoe: Will try and sort the horn myself first, naturally x
12/10/2015, 22:49 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
12/10/2015, 22:49 - abigailcoe: Pahahaaaa x
12/10/2015, 22:50 - Big Ran: Hahaha what? Is that akwikfit video or something? X
12/10/2015, 22:51 - abigailcoe: Some American bullshit on YouTube x
12/10/2015, 22:51 - abigailcoe: But I will check the fuse, thank you very much x
12/10/2015, 22:51 - Big Ran: Haha it looks like harry too.  Cave man style and everything x
12/10/2015, 22:52 - abigailcoe: Oh god, it does!x
13/10/2015, 14:48 - abigailcoe: Edo made me sack money off. I'm annoyed with him.x
13/10/2015, 17:46 - abigailcoe: I UN-DUMPED HIM! SCREW ALL Y'ALL, I'M DATING MONEY! X
13/10/2015, 18:43 - Big Ran: Hahaha you're so funny x
13/10/2015, 19:20 - abigailcoe: I try! 👍🏼 x
14/10/2015, 10:27 - abigailcoe: The Doug Stanhope podcast would be worth it just for the little trails and adverts they put in it, they're almost my favourite part. X
14/10/2015, 17:54 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
14/10/2015, 20:07 - Big Ran: My first twitter experience has been pretty good.  I'm at doug Stanhope in bath for free! Well I actually paid for London already but i missed that so....  X
14/10/2015, 21:42 - abigailcoe: What the fuck! Amazing! X
14/10/2015, 21:42 - abigailcoe: Also, that picture up there is incredible x
16/10/2015, 17:21 - abigailcoe: Nick mechanic is fucking jokes. He said "obviously this is a dog end vehicle" when I'd barely said anything at all, and nothing about the car, and I was like 😳 x
16/10/2015, 17:27 - Big Ran: Haha yeah that sounds like him.  He's fucking hilarious,  he hates Olivia's car x
21/10/2015, 19:20 - Big Ran: Happy back to future d....  I mean birthday my love.  How are you doing?hope you're having a great day.  I'm excited for you coming to bristol next week xx
27/10/2015, 13:06 - abigailcoe: Alright pickle, what are you working the next few days? X
27/10/2015, 13:08 - Big Ran: Alright love.  I'm in brighton,  back tomorrow,  working thursday Friday and sat 😢.  Got to move house also or at least some big stuff xx
27/10/2015, 13:08 - Big Ran: When are you coming? X

27/10/2015, 13:09 - abigailcoe: Either today or tomorrow. Probably not today if you're not about. And the wedding is on Saturday, is it? X
27/10/2015, 13:11 - Big Ran: No its on sunday,  yeah Olivia has d bought a house! X

28/10/2015, 14:51 - abigailcoe: I'll probably be reasonably late. I'll text you later, I'm at Pickwick xx
28/10/2015, 18:48 - abigailcoe: Finally heading to Bristol, you at home? X
28/10/2015, 19:01 - Big Ran: Hiya,  yeah I'm home.  Bit stressed but I'm here,  see you soon xx
29/10/2015, 18:32 - abigailcoe: Can you also grab my chargers and spare cigarette battery and stuff please? Xx

01/11/2015, 11:45 - Big Ran: Oh shit
01/11/2015, 11:46 - Big Ran: I'm not there yet but we are on the way
01/11/2015, 11:47 - Big Ran: Jo was just leaving the house when u left but will be around in bristol.  Also Olivia has a key
01/11/2015, 11:50 - abigailcoe: I'll call Olivia xx
06/11/2015, 12:36 - Big Ran: Do you own a big Blue scarf from zara? I just found it and trying to locate it's owner x
06/11/2015, 12:53 - abigailcoe: Nope, thanks x
10/11/2015, 00:53 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
10/11/2015, 11:50 - Big Ran: Wow amazing, good work! thank you xx
12/11/2015, 15:01 - abigailcoe: I bought a lifetime subscription to a vpn for like £45. In your face BT! X
12/11/2015, 15:02 - abigailcoe: Do the hotspots work?x
12/11/2015, 15:12 - Big Ran: Good work! That'll show 'em! Also totally anonymous browsing from the government too. X
12/11/2015, 15:13 - Big Ran: I haven't tried the BT thing yet as I broke my even on my phone and so using Olivias old one x
12/11/2015, 15:16 - abigailcoe: I wish you would start a new tumblr with pictures of all the phones you've broken x
12/11/2015, 19:29 - Big Ran: Well I do have a box full of them so I could do a photo shoot but I don't think it'd be quite the same x
15/11/2015, 15:05 - abigailcoe: Torrenting at 4.5 MB/s! X
17/11/2015, 15:13 - abigailcoe: I wanna volunteer to help Joby distributing aid in Calais and such, but it scares me. Do you think I could hack it? X
17/11/2015, 16:32 - Big Ran: I think it'll be pretty full on but I definitely think you should give it a go.  Will be hard but worth it I reckon. If course you can do it xx
17/11/2015, 18:53 - abigailcoe: Free for face time tonight?x
17/11/2015, 19:03 - Big Ran: I'm free now ish sheet a fag but might go out in a bit
 Got to Skype though as my facetime still ain't working x
17/11/2015, 19:04 - abigailcoe: Sheet a fag?x
17/11/2015, 19:05 - abigailcoe: Ooh, we can see if my better internet makes a difference!x
17/11/2015, 19:05 - Big Ran: Haha after a fag x
17/11/2015, 19:05 - abigailcoe: I'll see you then x
17/11/2015, 19:06 - Big Ran: I think it's just shit whatever your Internet it but we'll see xx
17/11/2015, 19:06 - abigailcoe: 👍🏼
24/11/2015, 23:30 - abigailcoe: Do me a favour and delete our whatsapp chat and then text me so I know what happens xx
25/11/2015, 13:34 - Big Ran: Unfortunately it does nothing. I'm on Olivias old phone right now without my old chat backups copied over so it's the same difference really . I've tested it before though the deleting and it just deletes off your own whatsapp even in groups x
25/11/2015, 13:36 - abigailcoe: Amazing, thanks, that's the answer I wanted. Money dumped me yesterday and I got super drunk and his chat had disappeared this morning, so I was trying to figure out if I deleted it or something else had happened xx
25/11/2015, 15:45 - Big Ran: Oh that's rubbish 🎑 sorry to here that. You alright?hungover today I imagine . Big hugs xx
27/11/2015, 23:26 - abigailcoe: Happy birthday best boy! I hope you're drunk or something else, all my love, obviously xxx
29/11/2015, 10:34 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
29/11/2015, 19:10 - abigailcoe: Aaron's friend Guy is moving to Bristol in December, do you know anyone looking for a housemate? We call him baby sting, he climbs, he's great and he's very well house trained x
29/11/2015, 19:27 - Big Ran: That sounds like an ideal day at work to me. Was it quiet because of the ming outside? I'm hanging as usual but with fire and first dates and wine so it's all lovely really xx
29/11/2015, 19:27 - Big Ran: I shall put out some feelers about a house but I can't think of anyone straight off xx
29/11/2015, 19:31 - abigailcoe: It wasn't quiet, I was supposed to be setting up for the day but I was so tired I couldn't be fucked so I made myself some tea and ate some crisps with the movie instead x
29/11/2015, 19:31 - abigailcoe: Thanks, that's good of you for the feelers and stuff. How was your birthday? Xx
29/11/2015, 19:33 - abigailcoe: Also: can't decide if I should mix myself a negroni and drink alone or not. Thoughts? Xx
29/11/2015, 19:34 - Big Ran: It was muchus fun last night ,  the usual messyness but with some great memories I think. My actual birthday was lovely too, pretty chilled xx
29/11/2015, 19:35 - Big Ran: Always,  if you're gonna have a drink alone you might aswell make it a negroni x
29/11/2015, 19:35 - abigailcoe: Yeah, but I'm sad so I don't know if it's unwise xx
29/11/2015, 19:36 - Big Ran: Haha sorry it's taking me so long to type x
29/11/2015, 19:36 - abigailcoe: Haha, that's ok x
29/11/2015, 19:36 - Big Ran: That is a good point but I don't think you're asking the wisest person that question x
29/11/2015, 19:39 - Big Ran: Currently moving between white and red wine and looking forward to some whisky so.... X
29/11/2015, 19:39 - abigailcoe: Haha, you are typing at the speed of treacle x
29/11/2015, 19:39 - Big Ran: Some of the lines on first dates are just priceless x
29/11/2015, 19:40 - Big Ran: I feel like I'm stuck in treacle x
29/11/2015, 19:40 - Big Ran: I've actually had to correct every auto corrected word. It's pretty challenging x
29/11/2015, 19:41 - abigailcoe: Haha, life is hard x
29/11/2015, 19:43 - abigailcoe: Ah, fuck it. If I don't have a negroni what the hell was the point of me buying campari and martini rosso? Plus, oranges spoil x
29/11/2015, 20:01 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
29/11/2015, 20:08 - Big Ran: Yay! Big love to you from me and Olivia xx

14/12/2015, 23:42 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
15/12/2015, 11:04 - Big Ran: Wow that's a special pencil!  Looks like a wand x
15/12/2015, 11:05 - Big Ran: I know,  I think I'm gonna hold out for a few of serial at our maybe even the whole lot for my plane journey x
15/12/2015, 13:23 - abigailcoe: http://youtu.be/_YS2dSa-Ud0
15/12/2015, 16:58 - Big Ran: I just watched that this morning.  What are they on?
15/12/2015, 22:09 - abigailcoe: I'd hazard a guess at poppers. X
27/12/2015, 10:56 - abigailcoe: Alright ran, how's your Christmas? X
27/12/2015, 14:02 - Big Ran: Hi abi! It was lovely thanks,  the usual family shenanigans and whisky.  How was yours? Also how are you? X
27/12/2015, 14:22 - abigailcoe: Hello! It was really good thanks. Natalie and dad got so drunk on Christmas day they couldn't even play uno. We also had a power cut which was super exciting and very 80s. When do you leave for Peru? I'm generally pretty good at the moment, are you? I'm going to Amsterdam for a little holiday on new years day woo hoo xx
31/12/2015, 20:40 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>

11/01/2016, 21:21 - Big Ran: Dunno what Happened there. You wanna face time sometime this week?enjoy your ribs X
11/01/2016, 21:22 - abigailcoe: Yes let's face time! When's good for you? I'm finishing tomorrow at 9, I've got Wednesday and Thursday off. And I totally will. X

14/01/2016, 20:21 - abigailcoe: Ok. After massive password debacle, I am now about to face time 👍🏼
14/01/2016, 20:21 - abigailcoe: *able
14/01/2016, 20:23 - Big Ran: Just a sec I have to login on a different user account
14/01/2016, 20:23 - abigailcoe: Ooh, complicated
29/01/2016, 12:41 - abigailcoe: Oh my god, did you listen to Doug Stanhope? With the Bingo breakup? Hope you're having a lovely time love you xxx
29/01/2016, 13:56 - Big Ran: Oh no! I haven't yet,  I came into town with Olivia for her to get her flight,  there is wifi in the hostel but it's rubbish and so I couldn't download me podcasts.  I'm gonna try in the breakfast area instead.  Love you too xx
29/01/2016, 14:59 - abigailcoe: Let me know what you think when you hear it x
29/01/2016, 16:51 - Big Ran: I've decided to use some of my data to download it.  I'll listen to it after lunch x
30/01/2016, 13:22 - Big Ran: Well it definitely hasn't left me with a good feeling that's for sure x
30/01/2016, 16:07 - abigailcoe: Oh I'm sorry! I just found the whole thing incredible, they were all happy and laughing and it was weirdly amazing. How's Peru? X
20/02/2016, 17:30 - abigailcoe: Hello lovely, how are you? Bingo doesn't want to die any more xx
23/02/2016, 15:29 - Big Ran: Hello lovely,  that's good news about bingo.  I'm good,
Been in a house in the jungle for the last 10 days with no reception and just me and one other person,  had lots of fun,  she is from texas and we had an amazing time together although I had to leave to let her get on with being alone and getting on with her mission.  How are you? How is the winter going? Xx
05/03/2016, 15:46 - abigailcoe: That sounds so nice! I'm glad you're having a great time. I'm currently in bed with a throat infection, have lost my voice, but I'm all good, winter is going and it's sunny outside! I also found a boingboing article about getting an adapter for your sodastream so you can get the refills super cheap at scuba shops and the like, it made me think of you and Beverly. Lots of love xx
16/03/2016, 00:04 - abigailcoe: When you were a postman, did you read people's postcards? X
18/03/2016, 15:05 - Big Ran: I did at first but they are so rarely interesting,  didn't bother much anymore unless there was loads of time spare  x
07/04/2016, 19:03 - abigailcoe: Just checking in. You aight? X
11/04/2016, 16:10 - Big Ran: Hello Love, yeah I'm good, nothing to report really. I broke my screen on my phone again so have to type with a mouse, I'll have to wait til canada to fix it I reckon. boo. much love xx
26/04/2016, 16:19 - Messages you send to this chat and calls are now secured with end-to-end encryption. Tap for more info.
28/04/2016, 00:33 - abigailcoe: Arannnn! So I hear you're having a shit time and lots of your stuff is broken or lost. Can I send you anything or help to make anything better? Is posting headphones an option? Don't wonder how I know this - the women who love you talk about you because we love you. Love you X
28/04/2016, 01:08 - Big Ran: Haha you're funny. Oh women, they do love to talk don't they hoho. I've been listening to Adam and Joe a lot as usual and I just have one of their voices pop up saying things like that from time to time. X
28/04/2016, 01:13 - Big Ran: Will since you last had your report a few changes have happened. One being I managed to get WhatsApp working on my tablet, hence I'm here now and one being I bought a shitty android phone that I can do Wi-Fi hotspot with. I've also cheered up a lot, I got away from the backpackers, i think it was mainly them making me feel lonely. I'm staying in as place with parrots and monkeys and little tree houses, it's fairly cheap and not add glamorous as it sounds but hey. There is also hot springs just up the road which I visited today and was surprised about how nice it is to be in hot water on a hot day, I thought it was madness but I think I'm gonna go back in the morning again x
28/04/2016, 01:16 - Big Ran: Anyways I've probably woken you up or something as it's late there init. Sorry about that. Thank you for your kind words, there isn't much you can do really except I'm running out of money fast so if and when you can if love to be top priority on the pay back list as I didn't realise quite how expensive Canada is and I'm leaving here on Monday night. Missing you lots, we should WhatsApp chat sometime xx
28/04/2016, 10:09 - abigailcoe: Remind me how much I owe you? Xx
28/04/2016, 10:54 - abigailcoe: I've been saving regularly - it's quite incredible - so I can pay you back right now. I've already saved £900 since the end of February, I'm well pleased. Let's ignore the fact that I then spent £500 of it on car insurance though. So glad you're feeling a bit better, the monkeys and parrots and hot springs sound great. Yes let's whatsapp chat - shall I email you my rota so you can pick a time? Love you lots, miss you too xx
03/05/2016, 22:48 - Big Ran: Just realised also that I was say right next to my tablet x
03/05/2016, 22:48 - Big Ran: Damn fool
03/05/2016, 22:48 - abigailcoe: Haha!
03/05/2016, 22:48 - abigailcoe: Oh my god and your picture is normal and everything!
03/05/2016, 22:49 - Big Ran: Haha oh yeah of course that other one is on my Peru number which no longer exists
03/05/2016, 22:49 - abigailcoe: Thank god I didn't save it
03/05/2016, 22:49 - Big Ran: Well effectively
03/05/2016, 22:49 - Big Ran: Haha
03/05/2016, 22:50 - Big Ran: I only had one burger from Wendy's earlier, it was alright x
03/05/2016, 22:51 - abigailcoe: Wendy's? You need to be looking for higher grade shit
03/05/2016, 22:51 - abigailcoe: In n out is the dream
03/05/2016, 22:51 - Big Ran: I had two yesterday, but they were Peruvian burgers and they sucked
03/05/2016, 22:52 - Big Ran: I will find an in and out, also I need to find pancakes, good ones
03/05/2016, 22:52 - Big Ran: I'm gonna be so ill
03/05/2016, 22:52 - abigailcoe: I don't even want to think about Peruvian burgers and what they were like
03/05/2016, 22:52 - abigailcoe: Why? Have you been eating super well recently?
03/05/2016, 22:52 - Big Ran: I did actually find some amazing ones but mostly they were awful
03/05/2016, 22:53 - abigailcoe: Surely you've got less than no time to find pancakes and in n out
03/05/2016, 22:54 - Big Ran: No not at all, just even worse and I'm already ill but I'm not gonna stop, it's important stuff. Nash I reckon 7 hours is possible, maybe x
03/05/2016, 22:54 - abigailcoe: What kind of ill are you? X
03/05/2016, 22:54 - Big Ran: I better get on working out how to get out of here I guess, also need to go to best buy top but a better phone x
03/05/2016, 22:55 - abigailcoe: What the airport called?
03/05/2016, 22:55 - Big Ran: Oh just the cramps kind, and bunged up from air-conditioning x
03/05/2016, 22:55 - Big Ran: Dunno
03/05/2016, 22:55 - Big Ran: McCarran
03/05/2016, 22:55 - abigailcoe: You're ten miles away from the nearest In n out. Get a move on x
03/05/2016, 22:56 - abigailcoe: And look up the secret menu before you get there x
03/05/2016, 22:56 - Big Ran: Ahhh shit alright. I'll get surgery and spending stupid money. Wish me luck x
03/05/2016, 22:56 - abigailcoe: Ooh, get city mapper for Las Vegas x
03/05/2016, 22:57 - abigailcoe: Love you good luck let me know how it works out xx
03/05/2016, 22:57 - Big Ran: Love you too, I'll give you an update in your morning x
11/05/2016, 14:04 - abigailcoe: How's Canadadia? I take it you escaped Vegas with some money?
11/05/2016, 16:10 - Big Ran: I did manage to do the best buy and IHOP in Vegas, all by bus so I went past all the things but didn't have time to do any gambling really. Did get myself a new phone super cheap though. Woo! Getting into Canada was awful but it's nice now that I'm here and calmed a bit, very surreal though. Everything is so big. X
11/05/2016, 16:11 - Big Ran: I stayed at Shannon's for a week and now I'm on my first work away thing helping a retired couple with their grand garden. It's beautiful here, the are deer and hawks and eagles x
11/05/2016, 16:11 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
11/05/2016, 16:12 - Big Ran: How are you doing? I forgot to say the money came through fine, than you so much xx
11/05/2016, 16:17 - abigailcoe: Shiiiit! That looks so beautiful x
11/05/2016, 16:18 - abigailcoe: I'm fine, getting really excited about holiday next week and buying lots of trousers x
11/05/2016, 16:20 - abigailcoe: I'm Really glad I've paid you back 😀 Woo hoo new phone! What did you get? Glad you're in a nice place, hope it continues to be nice. Are you staying near to where Shannon/piano lives? Remember Piano? Xx
11/05/2016, 16:35 - Big Ran: Hehe yeah I remember piano. Piano no longer with all the swipey though :( it is very near in Canadian terms,  I guess in UK terms near too but still has a ferry involved. I got a Motorola moto g 3rd Gen for 100 dollars. I've flashed it with cyanogen mod and it is a super good phone for the money. Still only has 1gb of ram though but I'll get by. X
11/05/2016, 16:39 - abigailcoe: Skills! What are the old people like? X
11/05/2016, 16:44 - Big Ran: They are a gay couple who are well into neat gardening and don't like the government. They are lovely and great to talk to. Not so into the neatness but I dont have to be x
11/05/2016, 16:45 - Big Ran: I need to find a swipey keyboard that does what I want. I swap between so many that none of them know me anymore x
11/05/2016, 16:53 - abigailcoe: Ha, they sound brilliant x
11/05/2016, 16:53 - abigailcoe: What do you want your keyboard to do? X
11/05/2016, 16:54 - Big Ran: I just want it to type the words I want. That is all x
11/05/2016, 16:58 - abigailcoe: Hahahaha, then you just have to close your eyes and stick a pin in one and that's it x
11/05/2016, 16:59 - Big Ran: True it stop having different ones on different devices . I'm not convinced that the Google one syncs between things x
11/05/2016, 16:59 - Big Ran: Anyways, off to work . big hugs xx
11/05/2016, 17:03 - abigailcoe: love love xx
31/05/2016, 23:35 - abigailcoe: Hey Aran, how's it going? X
05/06/2016, 16:28 - Big Ran: Hello lovely, sorry I kept forgetting to reply till after you would be asleep. I'm good, nothing to report really, I've been gardening and rewatching house mostly. I forgot how much they used real or not real in their filming (dreams/hallucinations etc) although maybe it's just before series 4. I'm going to go hang out with Shannon soon, would like to find some friends, bit lonely out here. How are you doing? X
05/06/2016, 17:20 - abigailcoe: Oh my god I'm rewatching House too it is so good. I'm alright, bit anxious but I'm trying to ignore it. The weather is super gorgeous here today so I'm sitting in the garden drinking a mojito from a can. Why don't you try tinder or bumble for friends? I'm back on tinder just because it's annoying the shit out of me when Money goes on dates, even though I don't really want to go out with him. Anyway, rambling as per usual. Miss you xx
06/06/2016, 13:26 - abigailcoe: I don't suppose you've got time for a chat? I'm feeling really sad x
06/06/2016, 15:21 - Big Ran: I just woke up.. you still free? I'll make coffee because I can't open my eyes quite right x
06/06/2016, 15:22 - abigailcoe: Amazing, yes, I'm free for the next hour x
06/06/2016, 17:09 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
06/06/2016, 19:45 - abigailcoe: I CAN GET LOTS OF PROTEIN BY DRINKING BULLETPROOF COFFEE, NO?
06/06/2016, 19:46 - abigailcoe: Or eating lots of cream?
06/06/2016, 19:46 - abigailcoe: I could get down with that x
07/06/2016, 00:10 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
07/06/2016, 01:00 - Big Ran: Yes you can have lots of cream and bullet proof coffee. I'm not a fan of the protein stuff but I think people do have that,  if it's within the ratios then it's allowed. Glad he was nice to you, I'm convinced anyways x
10/06/2016, 12:18 - abigailcoe: I made bulletproof coffee with coconut oil and gave myself a day of the worst diarrhea I've ever experienced, was so bad that work paid for me to get a cab home 👍🏼😅 x
20/06/2016, 13:42 - abigailcoe: Hi.
I'm thinking about becoming a programmer.
I'd quit my job and get a loan for 8 grand and take a three month full time web development course with high job likelihood at the end.
What does that make you think?
Also: how are you?
X
20/06/2016, 14:05 - Big Ran: I thought about doing that too. It's a risky one with the debt and all but it's definitely possible. I think it's one of those things you already know if you can do it or not, the course sounds very well designed but only for those who it makes sense for. Try and speak to Ben tillett, he did it and got a job straight away too but he's a jammy bugger so...xxx
20/06/2016, 14:07 - Big Ran: I'm alright, got the waking up at 6 am because it's light and whisky thing going on. Woo x
20/06/2016, 14:16 - abigailcoe: Yeah, Charlie did it and he talks about it like a job at the end is a certainty. I just feel like a twat because I keep changing my mind about what I want to do, but really what I want is something that I can start doing now that doesn't take years of study and offers potential for progression beyond like 30k a year. Oh, and is Mon to Fri 9 to 5 xx
20/06/2016, 14:17 - abigailcoe: That sounds like fun! Are you still in the gay garden place? X
20/06/2016, 14:17 - Big Ran: No I'm at Shannon's on sofa, watching house now x
20/06/2016, 14:18 - Big Ran: Yeah I think Ben said it was about 60 percent of his class that got jobs straight away but they were the ones that got it and could actually programme x
20/06/2016, 14:19 - abigailcoe: Hmm. I think I could do it x
20/06/2016, 14:20 - Big Ran: I think you could too. Did Charlie do the course in the London college? X
20/06/2016, 14:21 - abigailcoe: Oh by the way, turns out Charlie cheated on me and there was a whole mess of lying etc which was fun. It's actually been super useful because I definitely don't want to date him any more. We're still friends. X
20/06/2016, 14:21 - abigailcoe: Yeah, General Assembly x
20/06/2016, 14:21 - Big Ran: Ohhhh no way. I see so is that why he wanted to stop dating? So you were friends again before you knew?
20/06/2016, 14:25 - abigailcoe: It seems as though he wanted to stop dating just at the moments his conscience caught up with him. It's definitely the reason why he didn't want to start dating again, because he knows he always ends up losing people this way, and like he said, friendship is more important to him than dating. He basically just cheats on everyone and always has done. Yeah, I just found out like a week ago, so we'd been friends for...four months since we broke up last x
20/06/2016, 14:26 - abigailcoe: Also found out that his dad is in prison for murder. I feel really sorry for the little fucker, he grew up in less than ideal circumstances x
20/06/2016, 14:26 - Big Ran: Hmm yeah it makes sense, some people are just super troubled. Yeah I feel sorry for him too. That really sucks x
20/06/2016, 14:29 - abigailcoe: Yeah I know. I feel like everyone I know probably hates him, and perhaps rightly so, but I also really think everyone deserves a chance to have a normal human relationship so I'm gonna carry on being his friend. Despite the amount he lied, I honestly don't think he did any of it out of malice x
20/06/2016, 14:31 - Big Ran: No exactly, people just fuck up because they don't know how to relate to people much, chances are good I think and friendship helps learn honesty and trust n all that jazz. Maybe he can lend you the 8 grand too? Haha x
20/06/2016, 14:31 - Big Ran: Jokes
20/06/2016, 14:33 - abigailcoe: Haha, as if it didn't cross my mind x
20/06/2016, 14:34 - abigailcoe: Oh thank fuck for you basically. You just understand this stuff. Thanks for being so good, I'm so glad you're my friend xx
20/06/2016, 14:35 - Big Ran: Oh Abi, I'm so glad you're my friend too xxx
20/06/2016, 14:36 - abigailcoe: I can't wait till I get to see you next xxx
20/06/2016, 14:37 - Big Ran: Me too. I miss you. Also update on the apps to make friends thing. It sucks! I can't do it x
20/06/2016, 14:38 - abigailcoe: tinder and bumble? Why not? Have you tired Craigslist? X
20/06/2016, 14:38 - abigailcoe: I think if we'd grown up in the Bronx in the 80s and our dad was a drug dealer and we got racisted at every day and worried about getting stabbed on the way home from school we'd probably be Twats too x
20/06/2016, 14:39 - Big Ran: Yeah exactly, and maybe other scenarios x
20/06/2016, 14:41 - Big Ran: Yeah tinder and bumble, I found an amazing woman who was super cute and we were chatting and then she just deleted me. I think most people are looking to date really and has i not been leaving we totally would have met up. Meh x
20/06/2016, 14:41 - abigailcoe: Buuuums x
20/06/2016, 14:42 - abigailcoe: Are you saying just friends in your bio? I keep telling Charlie to do this because he just Fucks over one girl after another and all he wants is buddies x
20/06/2016, 14:42 - Big Ran: Also I'm in a stupid place with loads of islands and sea and two countries which makes it complicated with the distance thing cos 12 miles could be in the states x
20/06/2016, 14:42 - abigailcoe: Ahhh, fuck! X
20/06/2016, 14:43 - Big Ran: I tried friends on bio, got not many matches and ran out of people so deleted it and now I've not explicitly said so but saying in messages straight away instead, seems to work better but still... x
20/06/2016, 14:44 - abigailcoe: That sounds like progress at least x
20/06/2016, 14:44 - Big Ran: I'm not opposed to dating, meting all their friends etc, just most people don't want to go on dates with someone they know if leaving, losers x
20/06/2016, 14:46 - abigailcoe: They are losers, so true. I mean it's not like you'd have to stop being friends when you leave? This isn't dating! Omg my penpal Bill who I met on okcupid in like 2009 or whatever is coming to visit me! X
20/06/2016, 14:46 - abigailcoe: From America x
20/06/2016, 14:47 - Big Ran: No way! That's good be super weird, fun! X
20/06/2016, 14:47 - abigailcoe: Do you think maybe they think it's all a line so you can just bang them and never speak to them again? X
20/06/2016, 14:47 - abigailcoe: Super weird fun?x
20/06/2016, 14:47 - abigailcoe: It will definitely be some of those things x
20/06/2016, 14:49 - Big Ran: Haha yes fun weird. Yeah I think that is what they think, almost every bio here has . 'No hookups' and also if say 90% mention dogs x
20/06/2016, 14:50 - abigailcoe: Hahaha whuuuut! What about cats? Are they not so big in Canada? IS THE CANADIAN INTERNET MADE OF DOGS? X
20/06/2016, 14:50 - Big Ran: Yeah it is I think, there are actually some ' if you like cats, don't bother' x
20/06/2016, 14:51 - abigailcoe: I really love how if I'm swiping a long word wrong I can just correct myself in the middle of the swipe and it often still comes out right x
20/06/2016, 14:51 - abigailcoe: Oh my god, really?! Charlie is going to go crazy he fucking loves cats x
20/06/2016, 14:52 - Big Ran: Haha yeah I like that too. I don't care whether people like dogs, I just think it's unhealthy how much really, bit worrying x
20/06/2016, 14:56 - abigailcoe: SAME. I'm like, can't we just live and let live? What's with all the militant cat hatred? Sure, have a dog if you want, but don't go on about it, just calm down. Have a biscuit. And maybe take a long hard look at yourself. x
04/07/2016, 22:13 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
05/07/2016, 18:35 - Big Ran: Nice! I just introduced Shannon to them a couple of weeks ago. I might make some Curry and get some Moor today . mmmmm
05/07/2016, 19:52 - abigailcoe: That sounds like a great plan
05/07/2016, 19:52 - abigailcoe: I also learned that angry boy made the adverts for them which is lols
05/07/2016, 19:53 - abigailcoe: How's things? Been up to anything?
05/07/2016, 20:56 - Big Ran: Things are alright. Been doing lots of lakes and floating around. Went to Shannon's brother's wedding, well not really a wedding but party which was fun. Met more family etc. Found q potential place to go and stay in the woods on a nearby island so hopefully...
12/07/2016, 16:13 - abigailcoe: I'm going to computer school! I start on the 8th August! X
12/07/2016, 20:23 - Big Ran: Amazing! good work, that's well exciting xx

12/07/2016, 20:24 - abigailcoe: I'm excited and scared but it's all good x
12/07/2016, 20:24 - abigailcoe: Also getting into watching Gravity Falls which is lovely xx
12/07/2016, 20:25 - Big Ran: I've not heard of that, is it good? I'm still on house, though nearly done x
12/07/2016, 20:28 - abigailcoe: I'm still on house too...but I just really felt like cartoons so started it and it's ace x
12/07/2016, 20:29 - abigailcoe: They had it on in the first cafe we went to in Amsterdam, without any sound, and I got so into it even though I couldn't tell what was happening and I've only just remembered to watch it x
12/07/2016, 20:29 - abigailcoe: It just feels nice, you know x
12/07/2016, 20:31 - Big Ran: ohh it's a cartoon. I shal check it out, have had a lacking in nice things x
12/07/2016, 20:32 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
12/07/2016, 20:33 - abigailcoe: Yeah, it makes me feel like back in the day when I needed to watch things that had happy lighting and such, like that, but also it's a bit creepy so it's even better x
25/07/2016, 19:35 - Big Ran: <Media omitted>
25/07/2016, 19:35 - Big Ran: Made me chuckle
25/07/2016, 20:28 - abigailcoe: haha nice
25/07/2016, 20:31 - abigailcoe: how are you getting on looking for friends on it?
26/07/2016, 15:44 - Big Ran: Not so well really. I had a lot of matches but people stopped replying mostly so I deleted and started again. I found some people though, they've gone now. Shannon found a new friend though and if I spend too much time with her I'll be totally in love
26/07/2016, 15:45 - Big Ran: But we didn't match on tinder 🙄
26/07/2016, 16:00 - abigailcoe: Haha, that's a great face
26/07/2016, 16:01 - abigailcoe: Where did the people you've found gone?
26/07/2016, 16:14 - abigailcoe: I've basically been working to make Money understand that if he wants to make friends using tinder he has to tell them that he wants to be friends and not mislead them into thinking they're dating which is what he's been doing with many girls all at once. It's jokes but we're making progress 👍🏼
26/07/2016, 16:22 - Big Ran: Oh yeah that is a fun game. I don't think anyone here is actually looking for friends in tinder so I had to go the deception route although without not saying I was levying the country of course
26/07/2016, 16:24 - Big Ran: The people I found when I was at a work away thing. They were working too. I brought them back to Victoria and they stayed for a few days but have now carried on their travels
26/07/2016, 16:42 - abigailcoe: Quick question: do Canadian people not put kisses at the end of texts like we do? X
26/07/2016, 17:17 - abigailcoe: I think just in general people who are looking for friends on tinder are thin on the ground
27/07/2016, 06:50 - Big Ran: yeah true that they are. Which is fair enough really as that's not what it's for.
I din't reply about the canadian text kisses because I don't have any friends to be messaged by. But I have asked around and I think mostly not no, sometimes though x
27/07/2016, 09:23 - abigailcoe: Can we facetime soon? Miss your face x
01/08/2016, 16:00 - Big Ran: Hello lovely. Sorry I forgot to reply before, I've been in Vancouver for the weekend. Yes we can soon as I get back from festivaling after Wednesday next week. X
02/08/2016, 13:45 - abigailcoe: That would be great. It'll have to be a weekend because the course is gonna be intense. Hope you're good at the moment. I'm having a proper spazz this week, and poor Charlie(Money) is copping most of the flack. He's dealing with it pretty well, thankfully. X
24/08/2016, 19:59 - abigailcoe: Hello love, hope you're good. This is some magical shit our teacher showed us, it's basically popcorn time from your terminal with any magnet link. I've used it and it's ACES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bh8uCkm_K0c Love xx
28/08/2016, 15:57 - abigailcoe: Aran! When shall we facetime? xx
28/08/2016, 23:22 - Big Ran: Hello lovely! We can tomorrow if you like as I got back but I'm guessing you're back at college though. I also an coming home really soon. Way too soon xx
28/08/2016, 23:25 - abigailcoe: Ermagherd I would love that! But yeah I'm back at school so it'll be lunch break or late - would either of those work? You're coming home soon?? We definitely need a catch up xx
29/08/2016, 19:09 - abigailcoe: Fact: I've started eating halloumi 😮
29/08/2016, 19:32 - Big Ran: That is good news!
29/08/2016, 19:42 - abigailcoe: It is pretty delicious. Have you time for facetime today? X
30/08/2016, 03:53 - Big Ran: Sorry I had a really grumpy day where everything went wrong and then I had to do lots of diving picking things up etc. Badly planned sorry. I'm flying back on 11 Sept so nearly home really xx
30/08/2016, 03:54 - Big Ran: I am much happier and drunker now , just ate a Buffalo Burger mmmmm x
30/08/2016, 08:06 - abigailcoe: That's ok no worries I have really grumpy days plenty I totally get it. Burger sounds great, I had a burger yesterday too. Hope you're still having lots of fun xx
30/08/2016, 08:06 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
14/09/2016, 20:32 - abigailcoe: YOU'RE BACK!!! 😀😀😀❤🎀💗👌🏼🤘🏼🙇🏼🍾
15/09/2016, 07:42 - Big Ran: Wii woo Wei EU woo hi Abi! Xxxx
15/09/2016, 12:03 - abigailcoe: Hi Aran! Let's talk or facetime soon I miss your face always xxxx
16/09/2016, 00:55 - abigailcoe: I'm Obsessed with brick's whispering in The Middle x
16/09/2016, 07:33 - Big Ran: Ha, it's so early; it took me so long to get what that meant, I love it x
20/09/2016, 20:02 - abigailcoe: If I said to you that my ex who cheated on me now has a tattoo of a cartoon egg on his arm in honour of me, I'm sure you'd think I was relating the plot of a shit mumblecore movie and pretending it was my life, when in fact that is all true. Pretty incredible, I'm sure you'll agree. Hope you're good xx
20/09/2016, 20:07 - Big Ran: Haha that's amazing. Real life sometimes pulls through x
20/09/2016, 20:08 - Big Ran: How's you and how's your course going? X
20/09/2016, 20:10 - abigailcoe: I'm OK :) bit sick today but let's ignore that x
20/09/2016, 20:10 - abigailcoe: The course is the best thing ever, like actually really. Best decision I ever made. It's so hard but so so so brilliant. I want you to do it too x
20/09/2016, 20:11 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
20/09/2016, 20:19 - Big Ran: Hehe that's cute x
20/09/2016, 20:20 - Big Ran: I want to do the course too I think but I'm going to try and finish my degree first . I've enrolled on a user experienced based computer course four this year, and Spanish x
20/09/2016, 20:27 - abigailcoe: Oooh, that sounds good! How many more courses do you have to do until you're finished? X
20/09/2016, 20:28 - abigailcoe: You should so do the course when you're ready, I think about you so often when I'm in school and how it would suit you so well x
20/09/2016, 20:28 - Big Ran: Well I'm going to do these two, then I have to do two More, so I'd I could find a east of living for free or close next year I could in theory finish it x
20/09/2016, 20:30 - Big Ran: Do you think so really though? I'm really bad at getting stuck into things? I trust your judgement though as you're doing it and you know me pretty well. Terry is always of the opinion that I wouldn't make a good programmer but I think there are different levels and he's never used modern coding programs x
20/09/2016, 20:33 - abigailcoe: What do you mean getting stuck into things? X
20/09/2016, 20:34 - Big Ran: Oh I just mean concentrating and actually doing things without getting distracted x
20/09/2016, 20:37 - abigailcoe: I absolutely think you could do this - and do it well. Coding is just about problem solving, and you do that all the time. In particular I think about you repairing computers, and when one thing doesn't work, you'll try another, and you don't get stressed about it or freak out, you just read forums and try stuff. You'd be way better than most people in my class x
20/09/2016, 20:37 - abigailcoe: My teacher who is amazing says "ANYBODY can learn how to be a programmer" and he fully means it, and you aren't just anybody x
20/09/2016, 20:38 - Big Ran: That's good to hear, like I said, I think you know better about this as you're actually doing it x
20/09/2016, 20:38 - abigailcoe: And there's no option for distraction, this is so relentless you're just swept up and spat out on the other side weirdly able to do it x
20/09/2016, 20:39 - abigailcoe: I think you're better suited to this than I am, and I'm doing pretty fucking great at it x
20/09/2016, 20:40 - Big Ran: Haha amazing, I'm so happy you love it x
20/09/2016, 20:42 - abigailcoe: Me too :) x
20/09/2016, 20:44 - abigailcoe: Our class all went for drinks on Friday, and this guy will says to me "I think you're a dark horse with coding" and this other guy, Ben, said "I don't think Abi's a dark horse, I think she's a horse" x
20/09/2016, 20:44 - Big Ran: Haha
20/09/2016, 21:09 - abigailcoe: How is being back though? X
20/09/2016, 21:11 - Big Ran: It's weird, so ficking busy everywhere in this country . I'm alright , is really nice to have a home again but I'm just not sure and being in the city so much x
20/09/2016, 21:46 - abigailcoe: Where are you? At Bev and Terry's? x
20/09/2016, 21:46 - abigailcoe: Let's just run off to factory cottage together 🤓 x
20/09/2016, 21:50 - Big Ran: Ah I'm back at Olivia's
20/09/2016, 21:51 - Big Ran: In my old room x
20/09/2016, 23:05 - abigailcoe: Oh that's extra nice x
20/09/2016, 23:06 - abigailcoe: Fit right back into the old nook x
26/09/2016, 11:46 - Big Ran: Hello lovely, can I  still have the BT password thingy? I lost the picture you sent me before so never tried it and right now my phone only works on gsm . xxx
26/09/2016, 12:03 - abigailcoe: Oooh...I don't know what it is any more - I'll try and find it for you xx
26/09/2016, 12:03 - abigailcoe: GSM will never do x
26/09/2016, 12:09 - Big Ran: Thanks love. No it won't. I bought an s5 but it's not unlocked yet x
26/09/2016, 15:40 - abigailcoe: <Media omitted>
26/09/2016, 15:43 - Big Ran: I know but I lost about 6 months worth of backup on my old phone :( thank you xx
26/09/2016, 15:46 - abigailcoe: I'm just glad it was there, I had no idea how/where I'd sent it to you before xx
28/09/2016, 07:52 - abigailcoe: Wait wait wait - is Rice Dream a pun on the radiohead song Nice Dream?
28/09/2016, 07:52 - abigailcoe: X
28/09/2016, 09:39 - Big Ran: Hmmm I'm not sure, sounds a but loose to me, it could be though, maybe it deserves some investigating x
05/10/2016, 19:54 - abigailcoe: Hey lovely, let's facetime soon please x
05/10/2016, 20:07 - Big Ran: I'm sick in the face so could face sick? X
05/10/2016, 20:07 - Big Ran: (I just have a cold ) x
05/10/2016, 20:13 - abigailcoe: I will accept face sick x
05/10/2016, 20:13 - Big Ran: You at home? X
05/10/2016, 20:14 - abigailcoe: Yep, you? X
05/10/2016, 20:14 - Big Ran: Yep.  Tucked up in bed x
05/10/2016, 20:14 - abigailcoe: Sweet let me just make a tea x
05/10/2016, 20:30 - abigailcoe: Alright just turning it on x
21/10/2016, 22:19 - Big Ran: Happy birthday you wonderful being you! Sorry I didn't call,  I've been waiting to see if I perked up to actual talk properly but it's not going to happen as it seems.  Love you and hope you're having a wonderful day (obviously nothing could compare to our special days out)  but still the best fun you can have below that standard xxx
21/10/2016, 23:53 - abigailcoe: I love you 💗 let's speak soon please xxxx
22/10/2016, 00:00 - Big Ran: Yes yes yes! To you love ¡¡ xx
